    "description": "Taking IELTS? Get our free IELTS video training course now Today we have a great guest! We have Lisa Biskup from English Fluency Now. Lisa is from the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Lisa is going to introduce us to Seattle and the Pacific Northwest and she is going to show us 4 things that are different or unique about her region.   4 Things That Are Unique About the Pacific Northwest:  People enjoy the outdoors: People are focused on the environment and spending time outdoors. Even though it rains a lot, people like to get out and when it’s nice out, people spend a lot of time sailing, boating kayaking, hiking, etc. The temperatures are mild throughout the year and it’s not “painful” to be outdoors.  They value local, organic food: A lot of people in this area value organic and local food, grass-fed beef, etc. There are a lot of farmers’ markets that people go to regularly. There is a huge market for this kind of natural food.  A vibrant coffee culture: Starbucks started here! Starbucks brought the coffee culture to Seattle but in Washington there are tons of local coffee roasters and local cafes. The local shops often roast their own blends and have followers. If you are visiting the US, it’s a great idea to go into a cafe or the same cafe every day for several days. You can meet real local people at these places. Try starting a conversation with them.  A progressive political culture: A lot of people value things like the environment, gay marriage, and other social issues. Medical marijuana is now legal. The minimum wage has just been increased from $9 per hour to $15 per hour. This is considered a “living wage.”  Visit Lisa’s website at http://www.englishfluencynow.com   Bonus vocabulary term: Crunchy This term can be used as an adjective and it means that people like to spend time in nature. It’s an American English slang term.   Lisa's Bio: Lisa Biskup is the founder of English Fluency Now, Inc. and the creator of the English Fluency Now podcast. She works as a private English language coach, helping motivated adult learners reach their fluency goals. Her audio immersion program \"Success with Stories\" trains learners to become powerful English speakers, so that they can speak English with confidence and ease. Lisa is a certified Bilingual/TESOL teacher who has enjoyed working with English learners for over 20 years.

    "description": "Taking IELTS? Get our free IELTS video training now What can you say in English to make people like you? Today you're going learn a few phrases, questions, and vocabulary words that you can use in any conversation to make people enjoy your company more.   Phrases to make people like you:  \"How about you?\": This is better in the middle of a conversation. People want to talk about themselves and share their opinion on a topic so give them a chance to do it. This shows that you are interested in the person and that's why they'll find you interesting.  Use the person's name: This shows that you care enough to remember the person's name. Use their name to show that you care. Try to insert their name at the beginning or the end of a conversation. Don't be afraid to ask for their name again if you forget it.  Do NOT use \"sir\" or \"ma'am\" in the US: This is too formal in the Northeastern United States or on the West Coast (Boston, NY, Portland, Washington State). It can also make you sound submissive or like you are putting yourself below the person.  \"You're welcome\" instead of \"no problem\": When you say \"no problem\" you are saying that what you just did for that person was easy and it didn't mean anything to you. \"You're welcome\" doesn't make a judgment about what you have done for the person. It's simple and polite.  \"What would you like me to do?\": This allows the person to be direct if they are trying to hint at something and it gives you a chance to help someone.      Have you tried any of these phrases? If so, how did it go? Do you know another phrase that will make you more likeable?

    "description": "Do you ever feel frustrated because you can’t travel to an English-speaking country to learn English? Today we have Ana Luiza from Ingles Online. She is going to offer you three tips to make it work from home.   3 Ways to Learn English from Home:  Don’t only read, start with audio: Don’t invest too much time in just reading if you don’t know the sounds of English. It’s common for people to start with just reading but they don’t use the audio to go with what they are reading. These students end up having strange pronunciation because they use the sounds of their native language. If you do this, it will be a huge waste of time.  Listen to things that you understand: Start with English audio that you understand but can’t use quite yet. Don’t focus your time on English that you don’t understand. Once you understand something once, you need to see it again and again and review it. You need to see it used in different contexts and see it being used by different people. It takes time to acquire the language. It’s a process. Don’t jump ahead and skip over words that you think you already know.  Start small: If you are busy and don’t have a lot of time consume English in small chunks. Fifteen minutes a day is great. Take small steps. Listen to English while you are doing something else like cooking.  Ana Luiza has shown us that it is possible to get better at English even if you can’t travel to an English-speaking country. Go get started with some of these tips and techniques today!   Ana Luiza’s Bio: Ana Luiza Bergamini is the founder of http://www.inglesonline.com.br, a website that teaches English to Portuguese speakers with a focus on comprehension and speaking, and features weekly tips and a podcast, and a multimedia course of basic English. Ana has taught English for over ten years and she now lives in London, UK.   Talk to us in the comments! Have you tried using any of these tips? How did they work? Learn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "Taking IELTS? Get our free IELTS video training course Do you have to make presentations in English sometimes? Do you know how to start your presentation in English? Today you’ll find out 3 awesome tips from our guest Carl Kwan! Carl has been on our show a few times this year! He is a presentation expert and he told us why it’s important to know your audience when you present and how to end your English presentation. Today he’s here to show you how to get your presentation started!   3 Ways to Start your Presentation in English:  Start with a surprising fact: After you state the interesting or surprising fact, tell people what they should do with it. This gets their attention and this makes it easy for you to show them what they are going to learn. This is a more effective way to start than saying your name or “thanks for coming to my presentation.”  Use a story: Talk about what you were doing at a specific time when you thought about your presentation topic. For example, “Recently I was having a conversation with a friend when she told me about a really interesting method she is using to learn English.” With this strategy you should use a time reference. Talk about a situation and the action that was going on at the time. Use the word “when.” Using “when” is a good way to introduce the topic that you are about to talk about. This will get your audience interested.  Use a question to talk about a problem and your solution: Start by asking “have you ever…?” Then say, “well, here’s…” Here is an example from Carl: “Have you ever wondered how you can use CNN to learn English? Well here’s a 5-step process for using CNN to learn English.” To do this you have to know your audience and your question has to speak to them.    Carl Kwan is a presentations, video and marketing consultant with an MBA who also has over 10 years experience as an ESL teacher. Carl was born in Hong Kong and immigrated to Vancouver, Canada at age 3. Like many immigrants, his parents always struggled with English. This eventually led him to pursue teaching English to help people like his mom and dad. Since 2009 he has produced presentations videos. Currently, his YouTube Channel has more than 120 videos on presentations.   Carl lives in Seoul, South Korea with his wife and son. He offers presentations workshops and consulting, he produces live and animated videos for business owners and works as a professional voice actor and radio personality. He believes that everyone deserves a chance at success. To learn more about Carl, please visit his website at www.carlkwan.com, check out his videos on YouTube or connect with him on LinkedIn. Here is Carl’s most recent website: Carl’s English And check out his photos on Instagram at instagram.com/thecarlkwan.  Have you tried any of these techniques? How did it work? Let us know!

To “mimic” means to copy. When you learn English, don’t learn from the written word. Learn from what you hear. Try to surround yourself with the language and repeat back what you hear. Don’t think about conjugating verbs in your head or making a mistake. When you focus too much on conjugating, it restricts your ability to take in new sounds in your head.

    "description": "Go here to read the full episode summary   Do you borrow or lend to a friend in need? Today, in #8 of our countdown of the Top 15 Fixes in English series, we’ll be talking about the difference between these two similar verbs!   You don’t want to let grammar get in the way of giving to or getting from your friends. But the verbs borrow and lend are tricky because they both mean to temporarily give — and yet they are different.   The key to using these verbs is understanding that they follow perspective. Consider who is doing the giving, and who is doing the receiving.  Lend focuses on the one who is giving (the one doing the action).  Borrow focuses on the one receiving (the one upon whom the action is done).    Here are some examples: I asked her if I could borrow some money. I asked her if she could lend me some money. Did you borrow it from her? Did she lend it to you?   Other Entries in the 15 Fixes Series:   Episode 165: Listen or Hear?   Episode 169: Speak, Talk, Tell and Say?

This might be a source of serious confusion for you if you are making the mistake of translating the word \"invite\" from your native language to English! Today you'll learn how to avoid one of the most awkward possible misunderstandings when you go out for lunch! Today is number 7 of our Top 15 Fixes to Tune up Your Porsche!   What does it mean when you \"invite\" someone out for dinner or for lunch? The verb \"invite\" just means to extend an invitation to someone to go out and do something together. It does NOT mean that you will pay for the person's meal. Are you translating this verb and its meaning from your native language into English? A lot of people make this mistake! In English when we invite someone to dinner we aren't sure who is going to pay.   If you do want to pay for someone you can say:  \"I've got this\"  \"I got this\"  \"Let me get this\"  \"This one's on me\"  \"I'll take this\"  \"Don't worry about it. I've got this\"    Other Entries in the 15 Fixes Series: Episode 165: Listen or Hear? Episode 169: Speak, Talk, Tell and Say?

Today, in #6 of the Top 15 Fixes, we discuss the correct way to tell others what you want to do, whether in the immediate future or many years from now!   \"Will\" and \"going to\" are interchangeable in meaning, but native English speakers tend to use them for slightly different purposes.   Will is often used in the context of a big plan or dream, often in the far future:  I will get married, eventually.  “Someday, people will live on Mars.”    However, Will can also be used if you have just spontaneously made a decision, at this very moment, or for promises:  “Maybe I will go out to lunch.”  “I will always love you.”    Going to is used for more specific decisions about your immediate future:  “I’m gonna (going to) go biking tomorrow.”  “She’s going to call later tonight.”  These rules are general. Remember, there are exceptions, and native speakers can be inconsistent. The best way to learn is to get out and hear native English speakers, and use the language the way you hear it spoken.   Other Entries in the 15 Fixes Series:   Episode 165: Listen or Hear?

Today, learn what poses can make you more comfortable and powerful!   Social psychologist Amy Cuddy says body language affects how we think, and how others think about us. When people are slouched and closed-in on themselves, they not only feel less powerful, but they appear less powerful to others. Consider: Are your shoulders slouched? Or are they back, with your chest open? Are you spreading yourself out physically? Are you smiling? Is your body upright?     Tips for power-posing your way to confidence:  Stand with your arms up, legs spread out, shoulders back and chest out. Take up space and breathe deeply!  If you can't do this at the moment, imagine you’re doing it, or do it in the bathroom before your important interview or presentation. You can even do it while talking on the phone.  Yawn! By yawning, we are naturally bringing oxygen to our brain, which makes us feel more alert and confident.    Have you tried power posing? Has it worked for you?

Read the full notes for this episode Today, in #5 of the Top 15 Fixes, we discuss a mistake you might be making when you translate your native language into English – and how to fix it! In some languages, the word for “people” is singular. But it’s important to remember that, in English, this word is plural.  People are interesting.  NOT: People is interesting.    The singular term for “people” is “person.” This is similar to the situation with the words “children” and “child.”  The children are good.  The children are energetic.  The child is good.  The child is energetic.    Other Entries in the 15 Fixes Series:   Episode 165: Listen or Hear?   Episode 169: Speak, Talk, Tell and Say?

Today, in #3 of our Top 15 Fixes, we talk about the difficulty of distinguishing when to use these two verbs!   Many English learners have difficulty using do and make, often because they are directly translating from their own language. But native English speakers make it even more difficult. Even though there are some basic rules for using these verbs, native speakers tend to break them.   Make usually means to create something, from the ground up. Some examples include:  Making food, a drink, or anything requiring ingredients  Making friends (creating friendships)  Making the bed or table (putting things together)  Making a phone call, or making mistakes  Do usually relates more to a responsibility, an action or a job.

Come back to our site   Taking IELTS? Get our free IELTS video training now   Use if the word ‘the’ can be a confusing. But there are some rules that can help you get it right most of the time.   The first requires that you consider whether the focus is on something specific, or something more general. When focused on specific items, use ‘the’. If you’re sitting at a table, talking about the food that is actually in front of you, you might say:  “Do you like the turkey?”  “Yes, the turkey is great!”  “Could you please pass the salt?”  When focused on more general terms, you don’t use ‘the’. If you’re discussing food in general, you might say:  “Do you like turkey?”  “Have you tried pumpkin pie?”  “Cranberries are too tart for me.”    Geographical terms can also be tricky for ‘the’. In most cases, large, well-known geographic places will have ‘the': the content, the Pacific Ocean, the moon. With specific countries, a country’s formal name might require ‘the,’ while a less formal name might not: the United States, the Russian Federation; America, Russia.   Other Entries in the 15 Fixes Series:   Episode 165: Listen or Hear?

Today, Lindsay and Kristy talk about 3 things an employer in the U.S. might look for in a job candidate!   Taking IELTS? Get our free IELTS video training course now   If you’re applying for a job, it’s important to know what your potential employer is looking for. Like any other country, the U.S. has a professional culture which places more value on some individual qualities than others. These qualities may be very different from what employers look for in your home country!   Some qualities American employers seek in employees:  Proactive attitude: Show that you are autonomous and energetic – the opposite of passive. It means to show up early, confirm the time you will meet, and say thank you.  Positive attitude: Americans like smiles. But it’s also important that you get along with others and not be pessimistic.  Communication: When you actively communicate it shows you are engaged. A big part of this is simply that you let the boss know what is going on.  Be a “Giver”: Show that you believe in the vision of the company and are personally invested in its success. In other words, it’s more than a job to you.    Are these the same traits that employers look for in your country?

Today Lindsay talks with Nick Vance about the 80/20 principle, and how it can improve your English conversations!   Taking IELTS? Get our free IELTS video training course now   Nick believes that 80% of the positive benefits of something come from 20% of the input. In business, some customers are more valuable than others. With friends, though you may have many, only a few are truly close. In learning English, most of the grammar mistakes a new learner makes are really the same mistake over and over. Correcting these most common 20% of mistakes would eliminate 80% of all grammar mistakes. The best way to identify these is by working with a teacher who can help point out your mistakes.   Another way to work with the 80/20 principle is to prepare answers to the most common questions you might get from native English speakers. This will help you comfortably get conversations started — which is probably 80% of the work! You might prepare answers to questions like:  Where are you from?  How long have you lived here?  What do you do for a living?    Do you see the 80/20 principle working in your life? How so? Share your thoughts with us in the comments section below!  Nick Vance is originally from Kentucky and has lived in North Carolina, Washington DC, San Diego and Portland. He has been living in Berlin, Germany for 2.5 years.  Nick’s degree is in math but he left that field when he realized how much he enjoyed helping others learn English.  Nick has been helping people improve their English for 4 years and have been teaching online via Italki for about one year.

Tag questions tend to begin with the statement to be clarified, and then end with the question. There are many possible combinations.   Some common examples of tag questions include:  “You’re from Washington, aren’t you?”  “You used to live in New York, didn’t you?”  “He can play the piano, can’t he?”  “Her birthday is in July, right?”    Are You Ready to Practice?

    "description": "Do you want some help with the local English in San Francisco? Today, San Francisco native Sarah Honour talks about how you can go local with your English in the City by the Bay!   Taking IELTS? Get our free IELTS video training course   San Francisco is one of the most unique and amazing cities in the United States. It’s residents are technology-centric due to their proximity to Silicon Valley, as well as health-centric and nature-centric due to the progressive philosophy that has long been part of the spirit of the city. Sarah believes that these traits are found in some of the language that San Franciscans use, and that knowing this terminology can help you fit in just a little better. Here are Sarah’s three top terms for your visit to San Francisco:  “Is there an app for that?”: App is short for application, as in for your phone. Because the Bay Area is near the center of a major technological development region, there are apps for almost everything in the city — from calling a taxi to getting your groceries delivered.  Organic, Local, Sustainable and Seasonal: Food quality is really important to San Franciscans. Organic means that no pesticides have been used, local means the food was grown nearby, and sustainable means the environment was not harmed to produce it. Seasonal simply means that it is the natural time of year for the food to grow.  “Where’s the wiggle?”: San Francisco is a great city for biking, but it is also a city with lots of hills. The ‘wiggle’ is the route for biking with the least amount of hills to go up.    Have you ever been to San Francisco? Would you like to go? Tell us why in the comments section below!   Sarah is a 31 year old American who was born and raised in Denver, Colorado, studied Communications in Seattle, Washington, and worked for almost 10 years as a nanny (or babysitter) in San Francisco, California.  She now splits her time between San Francisco and Sardinia, Italy where her boyfriend lives. She is an English teacher on italki, and is learning Italian and sampling as much of the amazing food and wine from Italy as she can.

    "description": "Do you want to get a job in the US? Today, Lindsay and Michelle discuss what you need to know to excel at an American job interview!   Taking IELTS? Get our free IELTS video training now   Job interviews everywhere focus on skills and training. But in the US, employers are usually interested in character as well. They want to know whether you’re a team player, what your potential is to be a leader, and how you will grow in your job. As such, they might ask some questions focused more on your behaviors than your skills. It would help to think about these questions ahead of time, so you can be prepared.   Some American job interview questions might include:  “Tell us about the most difficult/frustrating individual you ever had to work with, and how you managed to work with them.” By asking this, they’re seeing whether you can rise above a problem and keep it from affecting the company.  “Give an example of how you’ve broken out of a routine or when you’ve successfully developed a new approach.” Here they’re asking you to show flexibility.  “How do you schedule your time/prioritize time when you have a tight turnaround?” With this, you might want to explain how you ask others for help or delegate your work.    In answering all of these questions, try to tell a story from conflict to resolution, and keep it under three minutes if possible.   Do employers ask questions like these during job interviews in your country? Tell us about it in the comments section below!     Brad received his undergraduate degree at New York University in 1984, and spent the next 15 years in the business world focused on sales and marketing. After spending a year testing the English teaching waters in Korea, he returned to the USA and got a Masters degree in TESOL from Seattle University in March 2001. Since then Brad has worked in London for a summer, spent a few years in Ireland writing TEFL materials for the Wall Street Institute and other companies, and has worked in Germany and Austria as an in-house Business English trainer for companies like Siemens, Deutsche Post/DHL and EADS.

Today, Lindsay and Michelle share a story about one student who overcame his fear of speaking English by being an expert at something else!   Taking IELTS?  Get our free IELTS video training course now   An English student in an American business course had little confidence in his English abilities. But when the other students in his course discovered that he understood their subject better than any of them, he was asked to be their tutor. Of course, they wanted him to tutor them in English. This turned out much better than expected. As a tutor, he had to be in the moment and focused. He couldn’t worry about his inhibitions or nervousness, or making mistakes. And because of this, he was able to take control.   A classroom is a safe place to learn English, but you are expected not to make mistakes, and so you must focus on your own perfection rather than connection. Connecting with others is more natural. Try to get out of the classroom and overcome your inhibitions.   How do you practice English outside the classroom?

Get our free IELTS video training course now   Test preparation doesn’t have to be boring. In fact, it should be interesting. When you’re studying for an English test, it isn’t the same as studying for a math test. You need to activate your emotions so you can remember more. Reading or watching movies in English can help, but you can also practice writing essays on subjects that are interesting to you, or go out and speak English with native speakers. Think of it as test preparation.   As for taking the actual test, Jessica has four essential tips to give you an advantage:  Be proactive. Take an active approach that involves your brain. Try to think about and predict answers.  Trust yourself. Don’t start doubting yourself when answering questions. Often, your first answer is the correct one.  Follow directions. Tests are written by smart people. Don’t start looking ahead and trying to race the clock. If you do, you might miss an important instruction.  Don’t rush. Don’t worry about timing. Instead, focus on your English and do what the test asks you to do.    Have you done any testing in English? How did it go?

    "description": "Have you ever thought about taking the TOEIC? On today’s Test Talk, Lindsay and Jessica talk about using prediction in testing, and how it can help!   Taking IELTS? Get our free IELTS video training course now   When getting a bank account, cell phone, or internet connection in a foreign country, you need to be able to ask questions and know the right structures of conversation. If you don’t, you might not be told all of the information you need to know. By practicing, especially if you’re able to do so with a partner, you can learn to anticipate what might be said by the other person. Doing this is learning to predict, and see what you’re missing. It might make you a better test-taker.   A practice conversation might go like this:  “I need to open a bank account.”  “Okay, to open an account, please complete this form.”     “Where should I take the form?”  “Give it to the woman in the office down the hall.”     “When can I have my account? Today?”  “No, it takes two weeks.”     “Do you need my passport?”  “Yes, and your birth certificate.”    If you would like to learn about this strategy, hear advice on how to strengthen it with resources that are free online, and get a practice guide written by Jessica, purchase the full episode.   Are you taking the TOEIC-1?

    "description": "Do you need a plan for Writing Task 1 on the IELTS exam? Today, Lindsay and Jessica share two clear steps for helping you beat it!   Taking IELTS? Get our free IELTS video training course now   The IELTS exam’s written section is divided into two tasks. Task 1 requires you to interpret a map or chart in approximately 150 words, while Task 2 is about 250 words on your own thoughts. Even though it is longer, Task 2 is often easier for test-takers. Task 1, because of the vocabulary needed, can be much more difficult. The Task 1 chart is usually some kind of line or graph that shows a change over time. To give yourself the language needed to discuss this chart, a good tactic might be to read the business section of the newspaper and pick up the vocabulary you need – words like that describe change, like increase, decrease, decline and skyrocket.   In writing your answer for Task 1, keep it clear and simple. A good plan might be to discuss increases in paragraph one, and decreases in paragraph two. That way, your answer is organized.   How are you preparing for the IELTS exam’s Task 1?

    "description": "Can movies cause problems in speaking natural English? Today, find out why mimicking phrases from movies can make it difficult to have natural-sounding English conversations!   Hollywood is drama. Its stories are fiction. This means that the language used by characters is often unrealistic. Because of the unnatural dialogue, you don’t want to quote from movies unless it’s understood that you are quoting. Native English speakers do it all the time by slightly changing the tone of their voice. Even then, such quotes are usually made in a context that makes it clear that the usage is a little joke.   Some popular American movie quotes:  “Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna get.” – Forrest Gump   “May the odds be ever in your favor.” – The Hunger Games   “May the force be with you.” – Star Wars   “Houston, we have a problem.” – Apollo 13     While it can be fun to directly quote movies, you want to try to sound more like a real English speaker, not a fictional character.   Do you have any favorite movie quotes in English?

You want to do better than that. In fact, ideally your answers will be 2-4 sentences each! How can you do come up with that? Do some brainstorming. Think of the question words. Question words can help you think of better answers.   Vocabulary is also important in Speaking Part 1. If you want to achieve a higher score, you will need to use a range of vocabulary, including slang and idioms. The examiner wants to hear that you know more than what’s in your textbook. A good strategy is to have a short list of slang and idioms ready to use.   What are some good English slang words or idioms that might be helpful to have for Speaking Part 1 of the IELTS test?

    "external_url": "https://open.spotify.com/episode/6Vxp1wOKR7U5p7MI9ATKgq",
    "description": "How do you raise a bilingual child? Today, Lindsay chats with Marianna Du Bosq, a bilingual educator who has three ways to help you raise your child to speak more than one language!   The benefits of raising a bilingual child are many. Not only will knowing more than one language open career opportunities for the child when they grow up, research is also finding significant positive cognitive advantages to having a bilingual brain.   Marianna believes bilingualism (and even tri-lingualism) is definitely achievable if parents are focused enough. Here are Marianna’s three main points to focus on: Expose your children to quality language input. Read books, or even use audio books. This way, your child is hearing voices other than those of their parents. Create a need to use the language. If the child doesn’t have to use the language to get what they want, they’re naturally going to fall back on using the dominant language. Ask your family members help by only speaking one language or the other. Keep it fun! Children will be far more involved in the language if they are doing the kinds of things they already love to do.   Are you a parent interested in raising bilingual children? Share your thoughts or experiences in the comments section below!   Marianna Du Bosq is a bilingual mother, former bilingual educator, and lifetime language learner. She is the host of the Bilingual Avenue podcast and blog where she interviews parents and experts raising and teaching multilingual children, and provides an excellent collection of tips and strategies for anyone choosing this journey. She is originally from Venezuela, has spent the last twenty years in the United States, and is currently on a one year adventure in the Black Forest in Germany with her husband and two year old daughter.

The phrase “as long as” is a connector similar to “if”, or “provided that”.  It means that meeting certain conditions will allow something to happen. The emphasis is on the importance of meeting the conditions. Here are a couple ways “as long as” might be used:  When do I have to be home?  Whenever you want, as long as you bring the car back in good condition.     “Is your landlord nice?”  “He is, as long as we pay the rent on time.”    How can you use “as long as”?

Get our free IELTS video training course now   You will probably be asked to talk about the topics of home, shopping, food and studying in Part 1 of the IELTS Speaking Section. You need to prepare for this. One way you can do that is have some phrasal verbs. Phrasal verbs are a way to sound more natural and native when speaking informally. Though there are many of these to choose from, you only need to use of a few to stand out.   Here are five that are easy to use and will impress your examiner: Bone up on: This means to learn. It’s not only a phrasal verb, but also an idiom. “I had to bone up on my English studies.” Figure out: This means to learn the details of something, or discover how it works. “I figured out how to fix the television.” Goof off: When you are having fun, but not working or studying, you can say “I spent the afternoon goofing off.” Clam up: This is another phrasal verb and idiom. It means that you’re so nervous you couldn’t think of what to say. “I clammed up when she asked me to answer the question.” Catch up: If you’re behind, and you’re trying to shorten the distance, you might need to catch up.  This can be used physically, like you’re chasing someone, or with your studies. “I fell behind in my homework and have to catch up.”   Do you have any other phrasal verbs you’d like to use in the IELTS exam?

Get our free IELTS video training course now Our clothes affect how we feel, and how we conduct our behavior. Other people can sense if we appear confident and comfortable. Not only that, they might even reflect what they see in us. On test day, it’s important to project an image that says you’re intelligent, that you take the exam seriously, and that you’re relaxed. You want to be comfortable while sitting through the Writing and Reading sections of the test, but you also want to show your best self to the Speaking section examiner.   In order to do both, consider the following “business casual” items: Slacks: These are the formal pants that would go with a suit. If they’re black, they can go with almost anything. Boots and leggings: For women, remember to stick with something comfortable — no high heels. Blouse or collared shirt: For men, there’s probably no need for a necktie, but a nice button-up shirt can allow you to look and feel relaxed while appearing professional.   You might want to stay away from: Sweat pants or suits: These might look lazy, even if they are comfortable. Blue jeans: While jeans are better than sweat pants, you might look better and feel just as relaxed in a nice pair of slacks. T-shirts: This might come off as too casual — especially if its a t-shirt with images or text on it.   What are you thinking of wearing for your IELTS exam?

Get our free IELTS video training course now If you get asked a question that you can’t immediately answer during your IELTS exam, you don’t want to go silent. It’s important to keep speaking even if you need a moment to decide how to answer the actual question. Native English speakers use many different phrases to help them do this. It’s important to understand that using a time-filling phrase won’t hurt your score.  In fact, it’s likely to improve it!   Here are a few phrases to use if you need a moment to think about how to answer a question during your IELTS exam:  “Honestly, I am a little bit nervous right now and my mind just went blank.” This says that you’re being honest, and trying. “My mind went blank” is also an idiom.  “Frankly, this isn’t something I’m used to talking about.” Again, this is honest, and sounds like something a native speaker would say.  “That’s a good question.” This welcomes good intonation, and that will help your pronunciation score.    Other simple and common English time-fillers:  “Wow, let me think about that.”   “I’ve never thought about that before.”   “Let’s see.”    Which phrases do you plan to use, and why?

    "description": "Do you know how to interrupt others in English? Today, learn how interruption is a part of American speaking culture, and how you can participate!   Americans often interrupt each other. It can appear rude, and can cause frustration, but it happens. Don’t take it personally. Instead, learn how it works so you can take part in this aspect of spoken American English culture. There are many phrases you can use when being interrupted, or when interrupting others. Some of them include:  Sorry or Oops: These might be said not only by the person doing the interrupting, but also by the person who is interrupted.  Go ‘head (ahead) and No, you go: These phrases permit the other person to interrupt you.  No problem: This indicates that you are okay with the interruption that just occurred.    Other common interruption phrases include:  What was that?  Uh huh.  Oh?    What other ways have you heard Lindsay and Michelle interrupt each other on past episodes of All Ears English? Tell us in the comments section below! Learn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "How can you remember other people’s names? Today, learn three tactics to remember names in English, and why it’s important to do so! A name is a person’s most basic possession and part of their identity. It’s the sweetest sound to their ears. For this reason, Alan Headbloom believes it’s important to get a person’s name right, and to show an interest in it. But it’s not always easy to do that, especially with names you are unfamiliar with.   Here are Alan’s tips for remembering new names:  If a name is unfamiliar, ask them to repeat it. This helps you learn their name and also shows a respectful commitment to learning it. Simply say, “Your name is a little difficult for me, but I’d really like to get it right. Could you say it again?”  Ask for their business card. This works best in a business context, though students may also have business cards. Reading the name might make it easier to remember.  Make up a pneumonic, or memory aid. Think of what the unfamiliar name sounds like in your native language and use that to help you remember. This is a way to bridge your language and English.    Alan suggests you also learn common names in the English-speaking world, and that you try asking others if their names have any special meanings or significances.   How do you deal with learning new names? Share your experiences in the comments section below!   Alan Headbloom is an intercultural trainer, a professional English teacher and a talk show host. He frequently appears as a speaker on topics such as cultural diversity and workplace inclusion. He lives in Michigan, USA where he and his wife produce the show Feel Like You Belong, a show about immigrants creating a new life in the United States.

    "description": "Are you looking for an authentic English conversation? In Part 3 of today’s episode, Mo will show you three ways to develop authentic, bulletproof confidence when you speak English with his unique method!   In Part 1 and 2 of this episode, Lindsay and Mo had an authentic English conversation and analyzed what worked, and what didn’t.  Now, in Part 3, Mo discusses Be in English, his method for learning how to have the best conversations possible in English.   Here are the main principles of the Be in English system: 1. If you know enough English to listen to this podcast, you can discuss anything in English! By using creativity, you are capable of joining a conversation and having a voice. 2. Be aware of your self-consciousness and shame about not speaking perfect English. Accept it, realize that your English will never be “perfect,” but don’t get too close to the idea. 3. Work with “naked listening.” That is, listen closely to a recording of English. Listen several times if necessary until you can distinguish every sound. Practicing this will change your orientation to listening.   You can find and work with Mo Riddiford and his Be in English system on italki.   What do you think about the Be in English system?

    "description": "Are you dating in English? Today, we welcome back dating expert Jessica Coyle to give you four easy topics for conversation when dating!   Conversation can be tricky on a first date. You might be nervous, and it can be hard to know what’s safe to talk about. Jessica has a great acronym to help you with simple, safe discussion topics. It’s FORD, and it stands for:  Friends: If you have mutual friends, ask how your date met them. Or, if you don’t have mutual friends, ask if your date knows anybody in the area where you’re meeting.  Occupation: Asking about another person’s job is usually a good conversation starter. You might say, “What do you do with your time?” That way, if your date happens to be unemployed, they are still able to give an answer.  Recreation: Ask about what somebody likes to do for fun. You might follow up by asking, “How often do you get to do that?”  Dreams: This is good for asking hypothetical questions. You could ask things like “Where do you see yourself in ten years?” or “What would you do if you had a billion dollars?”    People love talking about themselves, so being interested in others is what might make you more interesting to them. When starting a conversation, don’t just ask a list disconnected questions. Follow-up with the other person’s answers to show that you are listening to what they are saying.   Are you dating in English? What are your experiences? Tell us how it’s going in the comments section below!   Jessica Coyle has been teaching English since 2007. She received her Master’s in TESOL in 2013, finishing with a professional project researching the use of improvisational comedy teaching techniques to teach English as a second language.

    "description": "Will you be visiting Ottawa someday? Today, meet Kathleen from Canada, and get 3 phrases to connect with locals in the capital city, Ottawa!   Canada is a multicultural and diverse country, and Ottawa is a micro version of that. It’s a city of one million inhabitants and numerous languages. It is also a city in touch with nature. With four distinct seasons, Ottawa has something for everyone. Though Canada and the United States have some similarities, they also have many differences. Among these are some subtle differences in using the English language. This includes pronunciation and some commonly used phrases.   Here are Kathleen’s top Canadian phrases to help you blend in when you’re in Ottawa!  I’m sorry: Canadians are known for being very polite. In fact, the culture can be so polite it becomes apologetic. Sometimes Canadians will begin a sentence, “I’m sorry,” even if they did nothing wrong and aren’t apologizing for anything.  Out and About: This means to go exploring or to check something out. A Canadian might say “Let’s go out and about,” or “I was out and about.”  Eh?: Often, this word is used the way an American might use the words “right?” or “huh?” It shows agreement or clarification with other people. You might hear someone say, “That was a great show, eh?”    Are you going to Ottawa, or Canada? Have you ever been there? Share your thoughts in the comments section below!   Kathleen is a native English speaker from Ottawa, Canada. She has been teaching and tutoring students in English and beginner French for over three years in Asia, Latin America and Canada. She also speaks French and Spanish, and so understands the challenges and joys of learning a new language. In her experience, conversation is the best way to improve language skills. Kathleen has worked and continues to work in the areas of community development, and is currently completing her Bachelor of Education. This summer she will be teaching in Ulaanbataar, Mongolia. She loves meeting people from different cultures and learning new languages.

    "description": "Come back to www.allearsenglish.com/282 Do you have difficulty jumping into conversations in English? Today, learn 6 phrases to help you enter into conversations with confidence!     Entering into a conversation with native English speakers can be difficult. They often speak fast and might not seem to offer you a chance to speak. Instead, they will expect that you are going to jump in and speak if you have something to say. This means that you need to show confidence if you want to get into a conversation. You need to be able to assert yourself and use the phrases that signal to them that you have something to say.   Here are six phrases to help you do that: “I see what you mean.”: This shows that you agree with the other speaker. It also gives you the opportunity to follow it up with something extra that comes from you. You could also say, “Yeah, I totally agree.” “Actually, I think…”: If you want to disagree, this is a polite way to do it. You don’t want to show too much disagreement if you’re trying to get into a conversation with a stranger, but polite disagreement might make for a deeper conversation. “Hey, I have an idea.”: As it suggests, this phrase would help you express a new thought. You could also say: “What about this?” “Me too!”: This can help show commonality and is a good way to start telling a story. It’s also a very relaxed phrase that sounds natural to Americans.   Do you find it intimidating to jump into conversations with English speakers?

Their shoulders tense up  They don’t make eye contact  Their tone of voice changes  They hesitate  They use “um,” “ya know” and other filler words    Today let’s find out how to save the interaction when you have brought up a topic that makes someone uncomfortable? What questions can you ask to change the topic?  “So how’s work going?” (ask about the person’s job or work projects)  “How are your parents doing?” (ask about the person’s family)  “It’s freezing today, isn’t it?” (or another weather comment)   “Do you have any vacations coming up?’  “Have you seen any good movies lately?”    What questions do you use in your culture to change the topic if someone is uncomfortable?

    "description": "Come back to http://www.allearsenglish.com/286 Are you going abroad sometime soon? Have you set an intention for your time abroad? In today’s episode Lindsay talks with Norman Viss, an expat coach who helps his clients make the most of their time abroad by setting intentions. How can setting intentions make your life abroad more fulfilling?  Think about what kind of expat you are and decide how that will shape your expat life:  Are you a foreign assignee? Has your company moved you abroad to work?  Are you an international student or former international student?  Are you a “love-pat”? (someone who has gone abroad because they have met a partner, are you a traveling spouse?  Are you a “greener pastures expat”? This is someone who has gone abroad to find a better place to live including retirees.  Set goals and don’t just “go with the flow”  Do you want to learn a language? Be realistic about what will be possible based on the amount of time that you will be abroad.  Be intentional about what kinds of friendships you want while you are abroad.  What are your areas of interest? Do you like desserts? Sports? Do you like history? What kind of focus will you have during your time abroad? Will you create a theme for your life abroad?  What about your work? What professional goals do you want to accomplish while you are abroad?  Consider how your life will look after your time abroad:  What do you want your life to look like after you return from abroad?  What about retirement? If you are going abroad in your 40’s or 50’s then it’s a good idea to think about the future after your time abroad.    The key to a happy life abroad is being intentional! Let us know in the comments below if you have been intentional in your life abroad and how it has affected your experience abroad.     Norman Viss put down roots in Nigeria (10 years) and the Netherlands (22 years). He has worked for mission organizations, churches and in the public sector for the City of Amsterdam. He holds B.A. and Master’s degrees, with majors in cross-cultural and urban studies and theology; he is also an ICF- credentialed coach.

This is one of the biggest challenge for English students, especially at work. Today we will show you how to get out of trouble if you aren’t understanding someone on the phone. We’ll give you 8 things to do before or during the call to get the help you need.   How to Rescue Your Phone Call:   Practice to listening to natives as much as possible in your daily life (podcasts, sitcoms, the news on TV)  Ask the person to help you:  “I’m sorry. I’m having trouble understanding you. Would you (be able to ) say that again?”  “Could you repeat that (for me) please?”  “Would you mind slowing down a bit? It’s hard to hear you.”  Ask the person to follow up with a summary of the conversation by email  See if it’s ok to record the conversation  Breathe deeply before you get on the call with a native speaker    It’s important not to be ashamed if you can’t understand someone in English on the phone. Don’t pretend to understand when you don’t. Use one of our strategies above to save your English conversations on the phone.   What other tactics have you tried to rescue your English conversations?

    "description": "Come back to http://allearsenglish.com/288 Do you ever get confused about whether or not you should tip in an American restaurant?   Do you wonder how much to leave?   When to leave it?   Today you’ll get insider information from Michelle, who used to be a waitress at an American restaurant.   In the United States you MUST tip in a restaurant. Servers only make a few dollars per hour.   They rely on your tips.   How much should you tip?   You should tip 18-20%. However, you do have a choice when it comes to leaving a tip. If you have bad service then you can tip less.   If the waitress is slow or has a bad attitude then you don’t have to leave a lot of money as a tip.   It’s up to you.   When should you leave the tip?   If you pay with a credit card they take your card and come back with a receipt and the receipt has a place to write in the tip and the total and then you need to sign the receipt before you leave.   If you are paying in cash it’s ok to leave the cash on the table but put it under a cup or a plate.       What if you are with a large party? (A group of 6 or more people):   In this case gratuity (tip) is usually included.   It’s added into the bill before you get the bill.   Make sure you ask if you don’t know if it has already been included.   In other episodes we will talk about tipping in a bar, a cafe, the hair salon, a taxi, etc.       What is your opinion when it comes to leaving tips in the US?   Have you ever made a mistake with this?

    "description": "Do you use a lot of English slang in your everyday conversations with natives? In today’s episode you’ll find out how to use the words “crazy” and “insane” as slang words in conversations. How to use the word “crazy” in a slang form:    “I know someone who’s totally crazy because he still hitchhikes.”  It was crazy for us to hitchhike. Those were my crazy days.”  “Are you crazy about your boyfriend?”  “What is the craziest thing you have ever done?”    The slang words “crazy” and “insane” mean wild and out of control. They could also mean unexpected or out of control. The words are also used a lot in song lyrics, especially love songs. If you use these words in a literal way to describe someone who is mentally ill it is rude. Instead you could say that they are “mentally disabled” or “mentally handicapped” or “mentally challenged.”   Have you ever tried using these slang words in your English conversations?

    "description": "Do you feel like you never get a chance to speak English? Even when you attend an English class or work with an English tutor do you leave the class feeling like you haven’t spoken at all? If so, then you are not alone. A lot of students feels this way. Today we have a guest, Jason Newnum, who is an American English teacher. He teaches on the italki platform and he is available for lessons now! Jason has a special class called “Student Speaks, Teacher Listens.”     Why did Jason create this class? Jason created this class because when he took Spanish classes he noticed that he was not getting much speaking practice at all. He felt discouraged and didn’t get much better. He realized that the same problem was happening with English students. Jason wants to solve this problem.   Why is Jason’s class different?  He makes sure that students talk more, about 80% of the time  He feels comfortable being quiet, he doesn’t get nervous like other teachers do sometimes when they are nervous so he doesn’t fill that space with meaningless chatter    A typical class with Jason:  He asks you what’s new with you  He gives you a short article or video clip and asks for your opinion  He asks great follow-up questions- directly related to YOU and YOUR experiences  He writes out your mistakes in the Skype chat box so that you have a record of your mistakes      Jason’s Bio: Jason Newnum teaches English as a second language, in Bariloche, Argentina, and lives there with his family. Although he received his university degree in Spanish and now lives in a Spanish speaking country, his Argentine wife speaks English and Spanish equally. So it’s difficult to force himself to practice Spanish, when it’s easier to speak English with his wife. So he understands the frustrations of having to force ourselves to practice a foreign language everyday.   Do you have this problem with your English class? Are you planning to try Jason’s class? If so, let us know when you are going to get started with Jason. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",

Tell us your story: http://www.allearsenglish.com/299 Get our free IELTS Chat Sheet at http://www.allearsenglish.com/evaluation   Jessica is the author of Hopeful Disasters where she explores dating in New York City. She is also an ESL teacher in New York City. Check out her blog here!   When you meet someone for the first time in English, whether it’s a date or just a first-time meeting with a friend or colleague, there are certain topics that you should NEVER discuss. Today you’ll find out what they are with our favorite AEE dating consultant, Jessica Coyle. A few weeks ago we talked about what four things you SHOULD talk about on a first date in English or at a first meeting but today we’ll show you what you should avoid.   4 Topics to AVOID on a first date or first meeting in English:  Politics: You can casually mention your political interests but don’t get drawn into a political debate or discussion. Jessica calls this “quicksand” because you can start to sink and you’ll get stuck and you won’t be able to get out of it. It’s better to bring up this topic once you already know someone well and after you know their triggers well.  Age: You should definitely avoid asking the person their exact age. Also, this means that you should not ask people about their timeline in terms of when they want to get married or have kids. It’s too direct and too intense for a first date or first conversation. You might terrify the person if start asking these questions too early.  Religion: You probably have a rough idea of your date’s religion and it will be important later but it’s too personal to get into during a first date. It’s ok to share your own religion if you want to but don’t ask the person directly what their religion is.   Education: This is tricky. Jessica says that the goal in not asking this question is to avoid coming off as arrogant or judgmental. If you ask the person where they went to school or how many degrees they have, it will be clear that you are fishing for information regarding their intelligence or social status. You might make the other person feel bad if you ask this question. Try to figure out if there is an intellectual connection instead.   Learn more about your ad choices.

    "description": "Get our IELTS CHEAT SHEET HERE: http://www.allearsenglish.com/evaluation   Most people think that forgiveness is weakness but today we’ll challenge your perspective with an awesome quote! Do you have any enemies? Do you have any “frenemies”? Here is today’s quote for a Deep Thoughts Thursday: “Always forgive your enemies. Nothing annoys them so much.” – Oscar Wilde   What does this quote mean? This quote is somewhat “cheeky” and it says that if we want to annoy our enemies even more, we can forgive them. Also, the quote is telling us that it’s better for us to forgive. It helps us lead healthier lives. When you have an enemy you carry a lot of negative energy around and it takes up space in your body and in your brain.   According to Mayoclinic.org, the benefits of forgiveness include:  Stronger immune system  Less anxiety  Lower blood pressure    A few great vocabulary words from today’s episode:  Frenemy: “Friend” + “enemy”= someone that you care about and you are there for them but you can’t get along with them on an everyday basis and many things about that person bother you.  To hold a grudge: You keep thinking about something that someone did to you, you hold on to your anger. You don’t move on.    Do you have someone to forgive? What is holding you back from forgiving that person? Share your experience in the comments.   Learn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",

    "description": "Come back and let us know your thoughts on this: http://www.allearsenglish.com/302 Get our FREE IELTS Cheat Sheet: http://www.allearsenglish.com/evaluation   Today we have a special guest on the show! Our guest will challenge your assumption that SPEAKING is the most important part of learning English. Julian sees learning languages as a simple, two-step process: Step 1: Learn the language that we need for our specific situation Step 1: Apply the language and use it     Julian’s 3 Tips- How to Keep it Practical: Try to do many different kinds of things in the language: English is a process. Spend time with it. You can’t HAVE it. You can’t GET it. You need to constantly maintain it. Julian says that there is no difference between “experiencing” the language and “learning” the language, as far as your brain is concerned. By experiencing the language in many different ways, we can acquire chunks of English which will help us to sound more native-like. You should try to encounter the language through reading, speaking, listening, writing, etc. Get a more well-rounded experience of the language instead of just focusing on speaking.   Try to get a balance between intensive activity and relaxed exposure: Some of your work should be deliberate, focused, practical, intensive study. At the same time, some of your work should be a more relaxed encounter with the language. You need to take it in in a way that is enjoyable and easy. You could try listening to music in the language or watching TV. The key is getting a balance between the two forms of learning.   Focus on things which are useful to YOU: Exclude things that aren’t useful to you. Don’t bother to learn things that you won’t need to use. According to Julian, we don’t become fluent in English. We become fluent in specific topics such as cooking, law, politics, art, etc. Choose your focus and pursue English in that area. Drop the idea of becoming “fluent” in English in general.   Julian’s Bio: Our guest today is an English teacher from England, living in Japan. He is the father of three bilingual children, is halfway through a PhD program in Psycholinguistics and used his insight about language learning to go from speaking poor Japanese in 2008 to being a translator in 2010.

    "description": "Come back and tell us what your dating deal breakers are! http://www.allearsenglish.com/303 Get our FREE IELTS CHEAT SHEET: http://www.allearsenglish.com/evaluation Today we have our dating consultant, Jessica Coyle, back on the show! Today Jessica is back to talk about the concept of chemistry in dating in urban US culture. Jessica is going to tell us how to know if we actually have chemistry with someone. Chemistry: A magnetic pull between two people where you seem to understand the other person and something is different about that person to you.  Two different types of chemistry:  Slow burn chemistry: You start out as friends and then chemistry and attraction gradually builds over time. Features of the other person that seemed strange or unattractive initially start to become endearing and attractive.  Quick chemistry/limerance: This is more of an infatuation. Jessica thinks that online dating and set ups reward this type of attraction. These connections can be really intense at first and then can fizzle out and not end well. At the same time, sometimes these attractions can work in the long run.    What about in your culture? What are your deal breakers when it comes to dating? In your culture, how much influence do your parents and family have when it comes to your choice of a partner?   Here are some dating vocabulary words that we talked about today:  Limerance  Lukewarm feelings  Slow burn chemistry  Quirks (personality and physical)  Deal breakers  Red Flag       Jessica Coyle has been teaching English since 2007. She received her Master’s in TESOL in 2013, finishing with a professional project researching the use of improvisational comedy teaching techniques to teach English as a second language. She has studied and performed improv comedy all over Korea, China, Canada and the United States.

    "description": "Get our IELTS Free Video Training   Do you know what to say to someone after a good or a bad date in English? Today you will find out from our favorite dating consultant, Jessica Coyle. You’ll also get some new English dating vocabulary and terms that you can use in the real world!   What should we do if we have just had a good date: (1) Send a text message that evening and say:  “I had a really nice time.”  “Had a great time tonight. (I) Would like to see you again.”  “It was really nice meeting you, let’s hit up (go to) the MOMA.”  “Thanks so much for a great time.”  “I enjoyed meeting you.”    (2) Jessica likes to research the person online after a good first date to find out more about the person.   If you had a bad date you can say:  “I didn’t feel any chemistry but best of luck.”  “I got more of a friend vibe.”  Key vocab from today:  To ghost someone: To disappear and stop communicating after you have been on a date  To do the fade-away: Similar to ghosting (see above)  A vibe: A general feeling or impression  To go Dutch: To split the bill  Jessica’s Bio: Jessica Coyle has been teaching English since 2007. She received her Master’s in TESOL in 2013, finishing with a professional project researching the use of improvisational comedy teaching techniques to teach English as a second language. She has studied and performed improv comedy all over Korea, China, Canada and the United States. She writes a dating blog called Hopeful Disasters.    Learn more about your ad choices.

Today we’ll show you some common English acronyms and what impression they create. We’ll also give you some alternatives. Here are some common acronyms in English when we send text messages:   LOL (“Laughing out loud”)- A lot of people get annoyed by this one. This could be used in a text message. A good alternative is “haha”   TTYL (“Talk to you later”)- This one also sounds really young. A more mature alternative is “talk soon” or “talk to you soon” or actually writing out “talk to you later”  SMH (“Shaking My Head”)- This is a newer acronym. You can use this when you disapprove of something that someone has done.  OMG: (“Oh my gosh”)- This can also be annoying. Other options are: “Oh wow” or “I can’t believe it.”    Which acronyms have you used? Let us know in the comments below. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",

    "description": "Get our free IELTS video training!   Do you know how to naturally talk about what you want in English? Native speakers use the verb “to want” in the past tense when we are making a request in the present tense. For example, you might call a colleague and say ” I wanted to confirm our lunch appointment for today.” This makes the message a bit more polite and more indirect.

Listen to the sample role plays in today’s episode to hear what your message should sound like. Here are the steps: 1) Greeting: “Hi it’s Lindsay” or “Hey it’s Michelle” 2) Why are you calling: “I just wanted to talk with you about tomorrow’s meeting” or “I’m calling to catch up.” 3) What they should do next: “Would you get back to me when you can” or “Give me a call whenever you’re free” 4) Your phone number: “My number is 359-284-9856″ or “You can reach me at 617-593-0952 5) Say goodbye: “Hope you’re having a good day” or “Take care” or “Have a great one”   Here are a few other tips: 1) Make sure they know how to get back to you 2) Don't ramble, don't go on and on, don't leave a long message, make it concise and tight and to the point 3) Do leave a message- don't call and hang up, it's better to leave a message with some grammar mistakes than it is to not leave a message and not connect with the person   Learn more about your ad choices.

Another way to say it is ” to have tunnel vision.”  Another word for obsession could be “focus” but it has more of a positive connotation.  When we get really focused we have to be careful of burnout.  We could get exhausted.  When it comes to learning English you should chunk down the learning into bite-sized pieces and be sure that you are learning in a way that is fun for you.     Come back to our site to leave a comment and have a conversation with us    Learn more about your ad choices.

This episode is about taking chances in our lives.  You may feel like you can’t be yourself in English.  Maybe you are funny in your native language but you don’t know how to be funny in English so you hold back.  But if you do that then you are “stealing” from the moment as this quote says.

Today we will answers these questions and we'll start with a question from a listener: Hi Lindsay and Michelle,First of all, thank you for your hard working that you offer to help people with their English. I really appreciate your hard work. Today I have a question on how to use the word 'edge'? I hear Native say it all the time in their daily conversations and each time I hear it means differently. Do you think its meaning change depending on the situation? Or it just has one meaning? Could you please provide examples on how to use? Thanks again for your awesome job!!Sincerely,Lydia S.  Make sure you understand every word you hear on All Ears English.

Click here to subscribe and save 50% There are many ways to use the word \"edge.\" Great question. There are so many idioms so today we are going to focus on just a few. Idioms with \"edge\":  Edge: “the line where an object or area begins or ends “- merriam webster  For example: “Be careful, your coffee is on the edge of the table. I don’t want it to fall off!”   To have an edge over someone: to have some advantage over another person   L: Do you think I’ll get the job?M: You’re the most qualified! You should!L: Yeah, but I think my competition has an edge over me because her dad works for the company.Edgy: This can be used to describe someone who is a little bit different  You might also say: “Rough around the edges”  M: That guy was a little too edgy for me. I like someone who is a little more clean cut.L: I know he’s a little bit rough around the edges, but his heart is in the right place.To be on edge: to be nervous M: Can I ask you a question? L: Umm...yeah ummm M: Woah, why are you so on edge? L: Sorry, I have a deadline tomorrow so I’m kind of freaking out! What ties these uses of \"edge\" together? They are all about being a little bit different whether it's physically or personality wise. What do you think?? Takeaway for today: Listen to native speakers. How do they use this? What questions do you have from today? Let us know in the comments below. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
