0:01:25
Not much. I have a question for you. Okay, I had a feeling. I'm ready. I'm ready. I want to know when is the last time you like panicked? Like hand sweaty, mouth getting dry and just panicked about something? Oh my gosh, that's a good question. I can't really think of any specific moment. That's a good thing. I'm jealous. I feel like it happens to me on the daily. Really? Oh my gosh, yeah. Wow. Well, I could imagine a hypothetical situation. If my dog got out of my control and ran away, I would definitely get that way. Because my dog is fearful. I think he would not. We actually picked up a lost dog last week. We found a lost dog. And we found his owner. But my dog would just run for the hills and he'd probably get eaten by a coyote or something. Like he's too fearful. He would not let anyone apprehend him. Yeah, probably for the bastard that he'll stay close. Yeah, I might always, my kids, my kids will just like, take off, especially when they were littler.

0:02:21
And if you lose a child in a crowd, I can't think of anything that will instill panic faster. Oh my gosh. And so what does that, let's talk about panic for a minute. Because our listeners are going to, this is a human experience. What does it feel like? Oh, for sure, your mind is racing, thinking of all the negative possible outcomes, right? Yeah. Your heart is beating so fast, definitely like math is dry. And you're having a hard time keeping your thoughts together. I think your kind of thoughts get jumbled. And you have an intense physical reaction as well as a mental reaction. So to have both of those combinations tough to handle. Yeah, it's a very biochemical process that happens. Right. You could feel it and oh, we all know it. We know it. And I think a lot of our listeners might be struggling with this happening when they are speaking English.

0:03:07
Right. I know when I was first learning French, I remember a few times, having to speak on the phone and panicking because I couldn't understand them very well. And I didn't really have the vocabulary that I needed to ask them to repeat or clarify what they were saying. Oh, no. So I would just sort of panic and hang up. That's so funny. That's so funny. So we definitely need to have the vocabulary. And today we're going to show you guys six strategies that are going to help you deal with this moment. When you feel that panic, and maybe we'll skip ahead to that one and then we'll come back to the others. Right. Is having a list of questions to get repetition. Right. Because if you had had those operate, you could have continued that conversation, but you had to hang up instead.

0:03:50
Yes, exactly. You need a list of ways to like, could you say that again? Or I'm sorry, what was that? Just a native natural. Because that just definitely happens. Sometimes the line cuts out or you miss something. Even natives are asking someone on the phone, especially to repeat, but even in person. If you don't understand, you can ask them to repeat. Or if you're not sure you heard correctly, you don't want to panic in a situation like this. And it makes me think about the IELTS speaking exam. Because we're always telling our students that they need native natural phrases for asking for repetition or clarification. Yes. Because this is going to happen. There will be questions on the speaking exam that you're not sure you heard correctly.

0:04:34
There's a word you don't know. And your zord does not go down for asking for that repetition or clarification, as long as you have a natural native way to ask. Right. That's so good. If you haven't heard that tip before, that means you're not listening to IELTS energy. Because I feel like we talk about this pretty often. So make sure you're subscribed to IELTS energy. That's when I are giving so many good tips about getting the score you need on IELTS, wherever you visit your podcast. I love it. So good. So guys, go over, check that out. That's so good. So I'm actually surprised that you don't lose points by just asking for repetition.

0:05:06
I feel like a lot of students might not know that if they're not preparing with us, you know, for the IELTS exam. So that's not a lot of students assume that. That's a kind of a common myth that if they ask for clarification or repetition, that their scores automatically going to go down because it shows you no flash. As long as you aren't pausing and hesitating and panicking, you're fine. Your score will be unaffected. You just have to have a native and natural way to ask for that repetition. Love it. That is so good. So whether you're in a test or whether you're just on the phone, maybe, make sure you have a list of ways to ask for repetition. Let's go back up to the top. So the second suggestion is what, Aubrey, what can we do to calm our physiological reaction? Breathe, right?

0:05:46
You focus on your breathing and have measured controlled breathing. It will calm your heart rate somewhat. It will calm your mind. So you know, take five deep breaths and then you'll be able to think more clearly about what you want to say, about what your next steps are. Yeah. So that's something we can always do and you could add to that, maybe, putting your feet on the floor and feeling your feet a little bit of mindfulness practice. And I would also put a plug in here for just a daily meditation practice, right? That's an idea. I have a meditation practice right now. It's not daily, but it should be and it needs to be. Because that way, what that does when you have a meditation practice, maybe it's 10 minutes a day in the moments when you're not panicked, you actually teach your brain to increase the response between like the space between stimulus and response.

0:06:34
So you're actually going to panic less in those moments. Does that make sense? Yes, for sure. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense to train your brain. Train your brain to relax and not go into panic mode right away. So we kind of get away from the brain stem, like the archaic brain, like the lizard brain, right? The, oh my god, panic sweat. That's the old brain before humans evolve, but we can actually meditate and teach our brain to live at a higher level and relax more in those moments. I even think about like, you know, when there have been situations where I lose one of my kids for a minute and, you know, a mom looking for a kid, if she's screaming and panicking, then it's taking more time for people to understand how they can help her, right? And so to be able to become and calmly explain to someone what's happened and what you need help with is going to save precious time.

0:07:22
So this is applicable in every situation where you might be panicking. Yeah. To take those breaths, calm down, right? But even with language, if you're on a phone call, for example, and you're panicking, you're not going to be able to think of what you want to say next. You're going to miss what they're saying. So yeah, just feel your feet on the ground, take those breaths and be in the moment. Yeah. I mean, panic is really just not very productive. Really? We can't panic while coming up with a way to connect, while coming up with a way to solve the problem that's at hand, right? So yeah, so this is the key. Being prepared, having a practice, knowing how your mind is going to react and how to combat that, right?

0:08:02
Yes, exactly. And so we talked about the third thing being asking the person just to wait, right? If you're on the phone, maybe you're talking to a customer service rep, just put the phone down, count to 20, ask them to wait and start again. And you can do this when you're faced with someone too. Just say, hey, I need a minute. Let me think about this. Just give me a second, right? Yes, for sure, right? Or if you're purchasing something in a store, I can see a situation where, you know, if you're kind of panicking, you don't know what to say. Just let the person behind you go next, give yourself a minute to get your thoughts in order. Yeah, give yourself that time. That could be a good strategy too.

0:08:38
Just step back. Why do you have to stay right there and be in the moment, be under pressure? Step back. Let someone take your place. You know, think through these things before we make decisions, right? Definitely. Yeah, I love that. And so this one, clarify, asking for clarification is very related to asking for repetition, but the difference is pretty key. Because it's like on the IELTS exam, if you think you didn't hear a question correctly, you're going to ask for repetition. And I could say that again, but if you know that you don't understand a word, if there's a vocabulary word you don't understand, if you just ask them to repeat it, that doesn't help you understand that vocabulary word. Instead, you need to ask them to say it a different way.

0:09:17
Say, oh, I'm not sure I understand what that means. Can you clarify please or can paraphrase and repeat back to them what you think it meant to make sure you understand? Yeah, exactly. So you're confirming what you think you heard to make sure and then you can start to answer and you can keep engaging. So there's a lot we can do without being, you know, dear and headlights, right? Do you like that expression, Aubrey? I mean, have you heard that expression before dear and headlights? Yes, one I've seen dear in my headlights and they do make that face. I've had to swirve to miss dear in the mountains. And it's just so appropriate for this situation where you feel like a panic feeling of, oh, this is going to be bad. Hey guys, this happened to all of us. It happened to me and Japanese and Spanish and French.

0:10:01
It's happened to me in life and other situations, right? We can empathize. We've all been through this. So it's a human experience. All right. Is there anything else that we can do? We have a few other tips. Yeah. So to ask them to say something in other words, because even if you just say, can you clarify please, they might not realize that you need them to use different vocabulary. So the way you can say this is, can you say that in other words, I'm not sure if I'm understanding. Yeah. You know, yeah. And don't be afraid to, like, let's say they use the word, um, assessment, okay?

0:10:34
And you're not sure you know exactly what that means. You have maybe an idea. You just say, you know, I'm not sure what assessment means. Can you say that another way? Something like that? Let them know the word that you are confused about. Native speakers don't mind. I've had, you know, I've done this in the languages I'm learning and I've had people I'm talking to do this. And I'm almost flattered. I'm almost, you know, maybe it's a teacher in me, but I'm happy to help. And whoever you're talking to is happy to help. Oh, for sure. And there are ways, guys, we could do another episode, Aubrey, which we should, to mask that you completely don't understand the word.

0:11:07
Like for example, something that native speakers will do is they'll say, what do you mean by XYZ? Totally. Right. And that, that is a way of, you know, maybe you don't understand the word, but it also could mean that I'm trying to see how you're using that word. So it's a little less than just saying like, I don't understand literally what that word means. There's ways you can hide from completely showing you don't know what it means. That's a really good strategy, especially at work, right? If you're like in a business media situation where you don't want people to know that you didn't understand a word for whatever reason, then yeah, that's a great strategy to say. What exactly do you mean here by assessment? I love it. I love it.

0:11:43
And then there's no substitute for good old fashioned practice, right, Aubrey? Oh, yeah. Yeah, just put yourself in these situations. This is our next tip. You've got to put yourself in these situations more often because the more, as we talked about in another episode earlier, more mistakes we make, the better we get at, you know, being in these situations. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I could think of this recently. I, not that long ago, I was in Mexico and we had lost my son's shoes on the beach. And so I, you know, I went and I was trying to find them and I was trying to use my Spanish and everyone kept speaking to me in English because their English was better than my Spanish, even though we're in Mexico, you know, but, and so then I finally started asking them, oh, can, you know, would you mind speaking to me in Spanish?

0:12:27
I really want to learn. I really want to practice. And then they were so great about it. They were so kind and I, it was almost like they were proud of me for trying to learn Spanish and for trying, right? We know that feeling in English as well. But sometimes, yeah, if someone's, if their language is better in a different language, they might have a tendency to respond to you, you might have to ask them like, oh, I'm trying to learn English. Can you, you know, can you let me try it? Can you, can you, can you, please? Yeah. I mean, that might happen. Exactly. Get into that situation for sure.

0:12:57
Practice, practice. And then you can also simulate these situations with a teacher. So maybe your first step is that you go in, you create a role play or then you extend the role play to be more spontaneous. Step one, and then you go out into the real world, you go to an event in English and you practice it. Yes. I love that, right? Have a chance to practice when it's really low stress. And then you're going to be confident when you're in a situation that's just a little bit more stressful. I love it. So good. All right. We have solved the problem of panic.
