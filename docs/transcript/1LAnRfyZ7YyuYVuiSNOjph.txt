It's going great Aubrey. I'm happy to be here. I have a question for you today Let's hear it. All right. So are you a pretty positive person overall would you say yes?

0:01:42Very much so I do Like a few people in my life that are a little more negative and I think that's pushed me the opposite direction. So I'm like oh It's hard to have negativity in your life. So I'm very proactively positive. What about you? Oh, yeah, totally on our show here at all ours English We are positive and yeah, I'm naturally a pretty positive person in general You know I see the glasses half full and you know We like to look at learning English as being all about connection right and so when it taught we talk about connecting in English It matters the energy we put out in the world right? Yes, so true, right? If I know you guys have seen this where if you have people who have a very positive energy you want to talk to them You're excited to talk to them you leave feeling great and you may know people with it It's a little bit the opposite where you maybe don't look forward to a phone call with that person You leave feeling a little down for whatever reason So you want to be that person who has that positive energy that people want to talk to and leave feeling great about your Conversation exactly and that's why words matter so much because you need to have you feel excited on the inside You feel positive which many of you guys do you want to have the words to reflect that right?

0:02:53So we need the vocabulary in English and then we need the energy to convey it with the right tone of voice Right exactly right? So think about at work I know a lot of you work in English and And there often there's going to be times where someone had some type of performance at work like maybe they gave a presentation or led a meeting and You can ask them after you know how did it go? Yeah, and this is a key question. Yes, that's our key question today right? It's to ask somebody how did it go and then notice natives we just say how did it go? How did it go? A lot yeah, and this is a great question because I mean you guys can take this answer in any direction You want that's why it's important for us to talk about this today You have a choice and you need to take it in a positive direction assuming it went pretty well Obviously if you know the presentation like didn't load on your computer You're not gonna say it was great when it actually didn't work, right? But this is when you know things went well you want to convey that to your coworker Yeah, I mean if it does go poorly like that think about you know instead of being real negative You just be like oh man. It was kind of silly this happened, but all in all it worked out right You can still put a positive spin on it for sure Because we figured out even if something goes wrong we figure it out we move on we make the best of it You know that's giving me an episode idea for another day We could show our listeners how to some things up in a positive way even if things didn't go well all in all or Overall or in general these are all things we can say guys will do that in another episode So make sure you have hit follow or subscribe or wherever you listen make sure you have subscribed to this show So you get more allers English so Aubrey should we go into some vocab words for our listeners of how they could respond to this?

0:04:38Yes, exactly right so we want to be positive You can first of all just say great and then jump right into decent what was great about it because if they're asking Then I think they would like to hear a detail about what was great. Yeah, and so much of this is your tone of voice Right, you can't say right right great great and then give more details that gets people excited to listen to you as well Yeah, that'd be confusing if you're like great sense like wait. Are you being sarcastic? Right and then another supernatural and native one is just awesome I use awesome all the time. I probably overuse it, but that's okay. That's me too I think people from the United States in general may be overuse awesome. I feel like I hear people say it all the time We don't even notice because we say it too. Yeah, and then the next one we probably overuse as well Amazing amazing and this is something sensational right above average Yes, it's supposed to be right so see like oh, it was really amazing So then when we hear we often will use it just to mean good Yeah, that's the thing because we do exaggerate a lot in American English everything gets kind of notched up a little bit Exactly, but again the intonation like you said because if you say oh, it was amazing Then with your intonation you're making clear that it was actually really great. Yeah, that's so true This is all about intonation. They need to hear it in your voice guys And then if we want to tone it down a little bit right and be a little more measured We could say it went so well Right just coming a little bit down from awesome and amazing when you say I'll bring that up Even the intonation there It's interesting because if you do set it set it with a monotone, you know, just it went so well Think about just a little bit more intonation to say it went so well, right and besides so a little bit It's a lot more native This episode is brought to you by Collox Hill for soft comfy stools He was colloxal with center the pink one that softened stools and encourages bowel movement to give reliable love and night Relief it's Stefan with everything you need to know about stools now I don't want to push it push it too hard, but I've even made a Stefan stool playlist to help you get a good feeling So try Australia's number one constipation tablet brand Collox Hill softened stools relieves constipation always be the label and follow the directions for use There's so much in the tone of voice guys I mean yeah, it's gonna be on the show We talk a lot about connection a lot about building relationships and you can see here that just the tone of your voice is gonna Help you build that relationship more than grammar. You know, don't worry if you're making mistakes But worry about how you convey your words. What's the energy behind your words? Okay? Yeah, exactly All right, the next one this would be if it wasn't Perfect right?

0:07:17There was a we're going to wear if it's not exactly how you would have loved But you know, you still put a little bit of a positive spin on it, but you could say it was all right Okay, yeah, yeah, I'm not sure It doesn't sound that bad right you see you're sort of trying to find the positive and it was all right Right, so they there's a there's definitely a rhythm to my voice where I'm looking at the positive part of that when I say that it was all right Okay, so yeah, and then I think the key is what you say next right because you could go on and on about everything that was terrible Or you can say it's all right let them know what wasn't perfect, but then you know what did go well? Yeah, I mean so much of life is how we choose to look at it We're not denying that you know things happen in life right things break presentation Projectors could break maybe your audience just doesn't get it, but we choose to see what we want to see okay And choose the emphasize. Yeah, so what else Aubrey? Let's keep going and let's imagine the y'all so this one's very similar to it was all right to just say Not bad, you know, that means not great, but not bad bad. Yeah, very succinct and clear and native and natural and then Okay, it was okay, right? Yeah, so it went okay They're not ever gonna use the ciph it was a fantastic, right? And we're like it went okay. Yeah average Yeah, and then maybe we have a couple more maybe two more for our listeners here This is an interesting waiter respond if I say hey, how did go? How did your presentation go Aubrey?

0:08:44You have to say um more or less This is very idiomatic, right? This is word for you know, you might hear that and be like I don't know what that means It's just a way of saying like It was okay. It's not bad. It could have been better more or less And I think I know in Spanish they use this He's I've studied Spanish maybe in French. I don't know how I would do they use this chunk in French Mm-hmm, plz. You want right and right? I know some Spanish totally So it's certain languages you guys know this you know what it means So go for it if you want to and then you could also say I'm sure next time will be better So here I'm still putting the positive spin on it by looking ahead. I'm gonna improve I'm gonna find what I did wrong. I'm gonna get better at it. Yeah, that's exactly I love that I love a person who even if things don't go positive, you know perfectly They're gonna be honest. They're gonna be real about it But then say you know what next time will be better. I'm looking forward. I'm gonna do what it takes to improve for next time You got it Aubrey. All right. I think that's it for today I feel like we've given our listeners a lot of great expressions and now I hope you guys wrote those down right Aubrey?
