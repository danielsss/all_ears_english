Hello, Lindsay, how are you? Hello, hello. I'm feeling great today. We are on the topic of dating again as we're in the last episode. But last time Michelle, we talked a little bit about the strategy, right, of combining online dating with impersonating. But today we're getting to the vocab words. Is that right? Yeah, some important vocab words for dating in the US. This is definitely going to be fun. Last time we were talking in general, I thought it was mostly with online dating.

0:02:01
And now we're going to talk about phrases that you need to talk to have to be able to talk about dating in English. What's the first one? Well, the first one is to go Dutch. Now I'm going to ask you a philosophical question, Michelle, before we talk about what that means. And do you think that when you go out to a restaurant with a date, should you split the bill or should the man pay, should the woman pay, should it be based on how much each person eats, what's your full? I think this is really tough, especially lately. I think definitely the culture is changing and shifting and how's it changing? I don't think that now, I don't think that women always want to do that. I think it used to be very popular, just like the man paid. And if he didn't pay, it was terrible. Unlike the man who was to pay.

0:02:55
But now I haven't gone on a date with a new person a very long time. My feeling is things are potentially changing where women also want to show that why should the man pay? Why should he be the one paying? A woman can also pay. So I don't know, but I do think in some ways it's still kind of ingrained that the man pays. I mean, with my experience of my husband, he did pay for the first several dates. And then I would start to like, we would start to split some things or I would offer or I would pick up a cup of coffee or something like that. But I have to say it was very traditional in the beginning. Interesting. So in American culture, we're kind of in flux, we may be transitioning a little bit to going Dutch. And that's what that means.

0:03:48
Michelle, to go Dutch is to split the bill. An old idiom, not sure where it comes from. Yeah, probably from the Netherlands. I don't know. But really interesting. The problem with having the man pay is that it presumes that he makes more money or that he's taking care of the woman. Actually in American culture, there's a real visceral reaction to that and people don't like that idea. Because women are in the working world now. They're making their own money. It's a new generation, a new time. It's not the 1950s anymore. Exactly. Exactly.

0:04:23
Exactly. So yeah, you mentioned one of the next words already, the bill. So the bill or the tab or the check. All of those mean the same thing is the presentation of what money you owe. Right. Exit the presentation. I like the way you said that. The presentation is a piece of paper usually of how much you owe. And we said the verb to use here, the phrasal verb actually for you guys today, is to pick up the tab. That's a casual way to say that. Right, Michelle? To pay. Yeah. You're the one who pays.

0:04:58
Yeah. I love that. I love that. And then another dating phrase is to get out. Now, what does that mean? To get out there. Right? That is that. Yeah. Go out into the world of dating. Like, oh, like, say you might hear somebody say, like, oh, you need, like, get yourself out there. You know, like, go on some apps. Like, we'll meet some people. Yeah.

0:05:17
Get yourself or put yourself out there would be another one. Right? True, true, true. And to get out could just mean also to go out, basically. Yeah. Exactly. So this is put yourself out there. Get out there. You know, someone is saying, oh, I'm having a hard time meeting someone, the right person. You could say, you got to put yourself out there more. Although Michelle, I kind of feel like when I'm talking about dating, it's all just cliches. Mm-hmm. Yeah. There's a lot of cliches.

0:05:42
There are a lot of cliches in there. But, oh, city noise. Oh, city noise. But, you're in New York. So, just in case our listeners are new, they know that you're in New York and there's going to be some noise once in a while. Those are the noises of the city, right? The city and sounds. Yeah. Um.

0:06:16
And then the last one, the last word is commitment, right? So what does that mean? So this means when you get more serious, to get more serious, maybe you get engaged, maybe you get married or maybe you're just going steady. It feels like a very 1960s term going steady. It just kind of means you're not really dating anyone. Right. Right. Just that person. Yeah. what do think about these terms for listeners to talk about dating?

0:06:57
Yeah, I think they're very useful. I think they also bring up some interesting cultural topics that you can talk about with your friends and have the same kinds of discussion. So I think they can be very useful. Yeah. Make sure that when you're talking about these things, let's say with a native speaker in the US, open up what it's like in your culture. Introduce your culture. Share pieces of yourself, your history, your culture with the person because they want to know, is it common in China or Japan to go Dutch? They want to know about those things. So guys, share those things. All right. Love it. Yeah.
