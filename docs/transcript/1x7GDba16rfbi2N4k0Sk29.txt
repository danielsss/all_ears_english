Michelle, I have a question for you real quick. Ooh, what is it? Yeah, how do you do when you make a mistake? How do you think of that or are you hard on yourself? Would you say?

0:01:43I have to say that I can be a little bit hard on myself with mistakes, but I know that I shouldn't be, but it's tricky to get in that mindset of not, you know, not feeling the pain when you make a mistake. What about you? Yeah, same here. I've historically been kind of hard on myself. That's why our idea of connection, not perfection, it resonates with me so much, right? It's almost like we are free to focus on the right thing, which is connecting. But yeah, I would say I am, yeah, I do notice my mistakes. I'm a little hard on myself. I'm probably my worst critic. Yeah, that's, I always think of that quote. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:02:22So today, guys, we have a quote for you from Einstein. Of course, Einstein had a lot of famous quotes. So I wonder if this is really Einstein's quote or someone else. But we, that's how we found it online. And this is going to inspire you to think differently about your mistakes. Michelle, do you have a quote for us? I do. The quote is, anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. Ooh, and it's just so true, right? What do you think when you hear that quote? It's kind of comforting. I mean, in a weird way, because it reminds me, you know, and it sounds like maybe for you too, if you tend to get like a set about mistakes, it just, it's just one of those things that is like, no, no, no, like this is, you mistakes are supposed to happen.

0:03:09If you're not making mistakes, it means that you're not learning, you're not growing. I just was watching something last night and they were talking about that idea. And I do, I do need to remind myself of this more, I think. But I mean, for our listeners, and this is, I think, very important because practicing your English can be nerve-wracking and scary, but the mistakes are okay. And just look at it as a part of the process. Totally. This really depends on who you surround yourself with. Like, I know in the entrepreneurial world, like the startup world, venture funded startup world, the mistakes that people make, they're so proud of their mistakes. They love to say they start their self-entros with, I found in my first company five years ago and I failed beautifully or I failed, you know, hugely. They actually brag about their failures. And actually what they say is venture capitalists prefer to invest in someone who's had a big failure.

0:04:03They actually look because that means that they have learned. It's actually a red flag if all of your companies have been successful or if they're second venture and your previous one was successful. It means you probably didn't learn as much. So mistakes are so important, but we know a lot of you guys are stuck in perfectionism, right Michelle? Yeah, exactly. This perfectionist outlook and like, sometimes it can just lead you to stay still, right? And we don't want to stay still. We want to always move forward when you make a mistake and you're moving forward. You might not give back one little tiny bit, but if you don't even try, then you're just staying in the same place. Exactly. Exactly. That's why it's so important, I think.

0:04:45Yeah. So I think it's really about developing a new habit, a new way of thinking about mistakes. It's really about what you do immediately after you realize you've made a mistake. That's the only thing that matters. It's how do you frame this? We all see the world differently. So why not see it in a way of, oh, okay, I made a mistake. Let's correct it now and move on or let's not worry about it because the person in front of me is still making eye contact and I still have the connection. Right. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. So don't worry about your mistakes. Just kind of, I don't know.

0:05:18Yeah, try and look at it as those entrepreneurs that let's talk about trying to be like, yeah, this is all part of my growing experience and this is a good thing. The mistakes mean that I'm learning. I learned from the mistakes. So good. So that's the takeaway for today and that's what we want to leave you guys with. Just be okay with your mistakes. Change what you think about right after you make that mistake and you're going to see an amazing amount of improvement and you're going to be able to connect with native speakers. So good.
