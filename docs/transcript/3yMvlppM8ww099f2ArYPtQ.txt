This is an all-ears English podcast episode 47. How to order a coffee and a pizza in English. Welcome to the all-ears English podcast where you'll finally get real native English conversation and fluency for business and life. We believe in connection, not perfection, when it comes to learning English. Now here are your hosts, Lindsay McMahon, the English adventurer, and Michelle Kaplan, the New York radio girl, coming to you from Boston and New York City, USA. Let's learn how to order street food in New York City. Today, get four new English phrases to order pizza or bagels from a vendor on the street, plus find out why only New Yorkers fold their pizza. Hey Michelle, how's it going? Hey, good, good, good, how are you? Good, Michelle, did you check out that episode yesterday from Michael from Happy English? What a New York accent he has. I love it, yeah, it's so cool. It's so cool, guys, if you have not heard yesterday's episode and the title of that is Foget about it, right? For New York City, English slang words that was so exciting and fun to record, and just, I just love listening to that New York accent. I mean, Michelle, you live in New York City, you're kind of immersed in that accent all the time. You told us that your dad has a little bit of that accent maybe?

0:01:52
I know, both of my parents. Okay, so having a final. Yeah, it's something, it's funny, like I love the New York accent, it's also sometimes it's fun to like poke fun at it a little bit. Which parts of it do you poke fun at the most? Oh, oh, what's my dad? I mean, I think the, well, I mean, there's a typical dog dog, right? Like, or the mall mall. But with my dad, it's the R, it's like, Salt and Peppa. It's Peppa. Yeah, like, yeah, so it's that lack of that R sometimes. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know on yesterday's episode, Michael taught us the term Agita. Do you guys use that word? I mean, I know I heard that word a fair amount when I was in New York. Yeah, Agita, tell us that. I know that word. Well, our listeners are gonna have to go back. Let's not tell them. Let's let them know that they need to, guys, go back to episode 46 to find out the meaning of that. That would be more fun. Okay.

0:02:54
I don't know if I know the meaning of it, but today we're extending this New York City conversation into street food. Because what is more typical in New York than grabbing a quick coffee or pizza on the street? Mm-hmm. Yes. And I remember doing one of my jobs. I would always do like dollar pizza during lunch when I first moved to New York. Oh, my gosh, pizza for a dollar. That was a thing. That's so awesome. Yeah. And it was pretty good, I think. That was fantastic. So usually pizza is not really physically on the street, but it's always in those little shops, right? Yeah. It feels like they're like in the little, yeah, I always feel like there's like on the corner and the right exactly. So you can just rush in there real quick, grab something. So today we're gonna introduce to you guys four key phrases that you can use when you order street food in New York or Chicago or LA or, you know, probably in LA, it's more taco that you're ordering, right, Michelle? Yeah, maybe, right, right, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let's let our listeners know what the first vocabulary phrase is, Michelle. What is it? Okay, so it's what can I get you? So this is what you're more likely to hear from the vendor, right? Yeah. Right, right, right. Yeah. Or if they're speaking quickly in my tail, like, what can I get you?

0:04:03
Right. Can I get you? What can I get you? And probably, you know, this is gonna come fast at you. Right? Like you said, they don't have a lot of time, so be ready for it. I think what our listeners can do, guys, what you can do is as you're walking up to that vendor, you can prepare to hear this or something like this. That will prepare your mind to understand it when you hear it. There's like that pre-step we have to do. Yeah, sometimes I like get there and I don't know yet what I want. And then they ask me right when I get there. And I'm like, I don't know yet. Yeah, I need a sec. Yeah. It's true, it's true. So that's the first one that you really want to be ready for. And maybe as a bonus, we could teach that Michelle. What would you say if you're not quite? Because that happens to me a lot too in pretty much any place. I just don't know what I want yet. Yeah. Yeah. I can't get that. They ask right away. So what do you typically say there? I just say, oh, I haven't decided yet or I'm still looking.

0:04:57
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't decided yet. I'm still looking. So guys, write those down as a bonus. And then, okay, what could you say if you know what you want? Okay. Well, you could say I'll take and then mortar. So like I'll take a slice of pepperoni pizza or whatever. Yeah. Exactly. I'll take a medium coffee, something like that. This is very straightforward, very simple. Instead of saying I would like to have that takes so long. Right? And it's not natural. I'll take blank. So simple and easy and just like New York in New York locals like it, like it quick and easy and simple. Don't they Michelle? Just simplify everything. It's like easy, direct. Okay. What's the next one? Can I get up and then? Let's get right. So like, can I get a, can I get a slice of cake? I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Also, I know some, I don't even know if any more. This is such a thing. You can tell us, is it, I know there used to be a lot of coffee and doughnut vendors and bagel vendors on the street in New York. Do you see that anymore these days or is that not so much a big question? Oh, good question. I, I used to just like sometimes get coffees like on the way to work.

0:06:09
Yeah, from those vendors, I think it's still a thing. Yeah. And there's even the very typical, I hope these are still around, but the typical cup that is like a blue pattern. Yeah, blue one. Yeah, yeah. That is so famous because you see it on TV shows and you see it all over the place and it's so New York. I hope that's still around. If it's not, I might, like, I wish I had bought one and kept it. It's so New York. I don't know. There's just these little artifacts from different cities that are all over the media TV and movies. It's just so typical in New York. I love it. Okay, guys. So that's, can I get a blank? Okay. And the last one, Michelle, what is it? Hold the blank. So like, that means don't put this on there. So like, hold the mayo, right? Yeah, this whole, hold the onions. Yeah, and obviously a more clear thing to just say no mayo, no onions, no ice. But this is kind of fun, kind of native and natural. Maybe a little old fashioned too, but it's kind of fun sometimes to be a little old fashioned with our English, I think. Yeah, so Michelle, let's, sure listeners, two role plays. We know they love role plays in the first one. What are we doing here?

0:07:13
Okay, well, you are ordering a coffee. Of course. It's kind of a complicated coffee actually. An abagle from a street vendor. I kind of have a complicated order here. So get ready guys. Here we go. All right. Here we go. All right. How you doing? Great. Thanks. What can I get you? I'll take a small coffee for sugars. Any cream in that? Yep. Two creams, please. Here you go. Oh, could I also have a blueberry bagel with butter? Sure, you want that toasted? Yeah, that'd be great. No, I want a blueberry bagel with butter. Oh, do you like blueberry bagel? No, I never, I never get a blueberry bagel, but now that I saw it written, I saw like, can think about. I don't like, I would much rather take cinnamon, raisin bagel or cinnamon raisin toast to so bad.

0:08:04
I like, I mean, my favorite bagel is everything. I like egg bagels, but like blueberry bagels. I don't have, but like I would take it right now if you put one in front of me. You would take it because of this. Have you had lunch at Michelle? You said hungry. I have had lunch. It's closer to dinner for me. Oh, that's true. That's true. Well, all right. Let's go back through this. So this sounded very New York, especially because you were playing the vendor role here. Right. And so you said, how you doing? Right. How you doing? Okay. So we're not necessarily doing the accent. You guys can go back and listen to Michael to get that real New York accent, but you know, they're likely to shorten instead of how are you doing vendors don't have time for that, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I mean, I think in general, a lot of people would say how you doing, but like I think it's a special thing. Hey, how you doing? Yeah. Yeah.

0:08:54
Exactly. And then you said, what can I get you or use that really? What can I get you? What can I get you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then you said, I'll take great to order. Yep. I'll take a small coffee. And I like that again, just because it's direct. There's very few words in that, right? It's very simple because my order is going to be complicated. So let my order be more complicated and let the wording be simple, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um, and then yeah, you might ask you if you want to cream and blah, blah, blah, blah. And the toasted bagel, you got to get a toasted. You got to get it to, it does really make it that much better. And bagels are kind of famous in New York. I love how today we're doing the two foods that are pretty famous in New York City. Mm-hmm. Well, and another thing in New York, I don't know if you've ever done this or heard people do it. People sometimes ask for it scooped out. Scooped out. What does that mean? That means like that it's like, it's often for people maybe if they're like dieting or they don't want as many carbs or maybe they just like the way it tastes. Like to like take the dough and scoop it out of the bagel so you're more so just having like the shell of the bagel and then like the cream cheese inside.

0:10:04
Or whatever. But isn't a bagel already kind of hold out? Like there's a hole in the middle of the bagel. No, this one's like you're making like a little moat on the inside. I'd have to see it to understand what you're saying. Yeah, but sometimes like that's not like a thing you would ask for it. Like I've been with Dan and like once he like asked for something scooped out in just like a like an actual like it was first of all I think we're in Rhode Island. And it was like some like small coffee shop and I was like no, I think it's a very either New York thing or just like I don't know a certain kind of bagel like a real bagel place. But like yeah, it's like you can't like you want to ask at like for like a Starbucks bagel scoop down. Well, maybe he will do a follow up episode for listeners on quirky orders in New York like quirky things people order in New York. Right. And what neighborhoods they order them in. So interesting. All right, guys. So in the next one now we're going to order pizza. Right. A slice of pizza. So what's happening here? Michelle with this one. Well, I am ordering a slice of pizza and and hilarity and so it's just kidding. I don't know. Well, I wrote this role play so hopefully it makes sense. Let's see as if I wonder how it's going to make sense. All right.

0:11:18
And then you're going to ask for extra napkins. You're going to order pepperoni and you're going to get a soda too. So let's get ready. Here we go. Here we go. All right. Hi. Can I get a slice of pepperoni? Sure. You want that heated? Yes, please. Okay. That'll be 535. Oh, can I get a few extra napkins? Sure. They're in the bag. Oh, perfect. And can I also get a medium orange soda but hold the ice? Here you go, ma'am. It's 820. Okay. Here you go. Thanks. Thank you. Have a great day. All right. So very typical. All right. Not too crazy. But it went pretty smoothly here. The ordering. What did you say, Michelle, from our vocabulary words? I said, can I get a can I get a? Sounds like it's from a song too. I don't know what song. It is from a song. It's been killing me the whole time because I want to say it so bad. Yeah, yeah, yeah, guys. So it's just coincidence, right? I suppose that's kind of used in a slightly different way. But it means the same thing. You're asking for something. Yeah. Yes. Exactly. But very common. Would you say this when you're ordering Michelle? Can I get a fight? Yeah. Yeah. Sure. For sure. For sure. That's what I always say. Yeah. Yeah. And then for some reason I decided to order an orange soda but not only an orange soda but just with no ice, which it sounds like a nightmare. I know. I know. I know. Because I think thinking about this realistically in this kind of piece of shop, which is a very small shop, I'm imagining four tables, three tables. You're probably not going to have it in a glass. You're probably going to get the can is most. Don't you think? Probably they're going to sell to you. Yeah. That's true. I feel like I always like one it started from the can. Like, you know, sometimes in a restaurant that give you the can and then the glass with a thing of ice. And I'm like, no, I just like. I feel like I feel like it tastes best from the can. That's really. That's interesting. I think sometimes they feel that way about beer. Like I wanted in a bottle instead of a can or I wanted in a cup or whatever. I don't know. We have our weird biases, right? Yeah. But do you usually get your pizza heated up because they can put it in the oven. That's a common question. I think too. Right. Do you want the select because usually they have the slices already cut up. And then do you want it heated? Maybe it's been sitting in the plastic and for the glass in front of you. Right.

0:13:28
Do you usually get your pizza slice heated? If they were to ask me, I might say yes, but I feel like sometimes I do it without you asking. Oh, yeah. True. True. True. True. True. True. Yeah. That's true. And do you fold here's another quirky New York. Oh, question. Do you fold your pizza? Yes. Very much. Okay. I guess I do. Yes. I don't know if I guess I used to not fold it, but like I'm a folder. I love. Yeah. It's so funny. Yeah. It's a very New York question, right? Because guys, the YMG is about the size of the slice. Right. Yeah. And you can usually just fold it in half. And then. Yeah. It's good stuff to fold it. I don't know why, but I like to do it. Yeah. Sometimes I unfold it for a little bit. Just to like get the taste. And then I'm like, I like it folded. I like the feel. Yeah. It's kind of fun. You get like double the dough at the same time. It's a very New York thing guys. And usually they'll put or sometimes I think they'll put it in a bag. We said sure they're in the bag. Like you'll have the pizza on a paper plate, right? And then in a brown bag. So very typical experience ordering. But the reason the fold is interesting. It's very New York is because in other parts of the country, for example, you order Chicago Sal pizza. You can't fold that pizza. It's way too thick. Right. Yeah. Yeah. It's a very special thing to. Yeah. So guys, now we want pizza on a blueberry bagel. I would take the pizza before the blueberry bagel personally, but yeah, guys, you're getting the real New Yorker insider knowledge.

Let's just let our listeners know that last one we did, Michelle. I think we didn't quite cover that. He said, hold the ice, right? Right? Oh, yeah. Sorry. Yes. Hold the ice. Right. So I don't want the ice. Don't don't want that ice. Love it. So good. Any final thoughts on ordering on the street in New York? Oh, I'm hungry. Enjoy your meal.
