What's going on Michelle? How are you? Hey Lindsay, I'm good. I'm good. How are you? Awesome. Today we're talking about getting into a university in the US. I know a lot of our listeners, they may already be studying in the US or they want to study in the US or another English speaking country like Canada. A lot of people want to go to now. Right Australia, right Michelle? Aha. Right. Oh my gosh. Australia. Oh, I would love to go there. Yeah, let's talk about our personal stories real quick. Okay. Michelle, where did you go to college? I went to the University of Maryland.

0:02:04
Nice. That was a big school, right? Yes, it's a very big school. Okay. It's a very typical college campus. Lindsay, what about you? Oh yeah, we had opposite college experiences, Michelle. I went to a small school, same regional in Virginia. In front of a street in Washington. Right. Yeah. It was only about 5,000 students. Oh wow. It was tiny, but I was actually looking at even smaller colleges than that. Oh my goodness. I'm glad I didn't go to something that small. But it was beautiful. The campus, it sold me when I went to visit. Just gorgeous Jeffersonian architecture. Add a blast. I mean college is great, right?

0:02:44
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Oh my gosh. It's a time. It's a very special time. I still look back at it, find fondly. Yeah. There's, you know, it's just kind of like a right of passage. A right of passage for sure. Then today we're here to give you guys three tips, three things you can do to make sure you get in, right? Because we got to get in before we can go. So what is our first tip to our listeners to prepare yourself to apply? This was even before you submit any applications, right? Right. Yeah. Well, here's the first tip. This is very important. The first one is clean up your social media accounts. Ooh. Oh my gosh.

0:03:20
We have this status as a 30% of American admissions counselors. Check applicants out online and maybe even higher than that. We don't know, but we know now whether you're applying for a job or a college. Yeah, we do this. Don't we? We search. Right. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. You don't want to have anything up there that could kind of make somebody question you. So, you know, just go just take a look through and make sure and better safe than sorry if you're not sure. Just take it down and then or put it back up once you're in college, whatever. Yeah. I mean, think of yourself as a brand. I think later in the next episode, later in this podcast, we do interview someone about building a brand of you, right? Branding yourself.

0:04:02
But think of yourself as a brand. Even at the age of 17, 18, you're thinking about college, you are kind of a brand in a way and you need to present yourself to this college. That also means I think getting on LinkedIn, Michelle. Oh, yeah. LinkedIn is huge. LinkedIn is very important. I feel like everybody has to have at least something on LinkedIn. Yeah. And a lot of our listeners on this show are professionals and they definitely use LinkedIn. We'll talk about LinkedIn more on all of our English, but there's never it's never too early to start. By 17, you've probably had a couple jobs, a couple internships. You want to go ahead and make sure you have a LinkedIn profile, maximize it, optimize it, get quotes from people, get recommendations. Right, Michelle. Do all of that stuff. Right, right, right, exactly.

0:04:45
Um, so shall we move on to the next? Okay, let's move on. Okay, so the next one is to stay on top of deadlines. And now I don't know if there's any tip that's actually more important than... Oh my gosh, it's so true.

0:05:29
You have, you know, in some cases you might have to take the SAT, the TOEFL, the IELTS, by the way, Michelle, if they're taking IELTS, where do they need to go right now? Oh, the IELTS energy podcast. Go over and listen to Jessica and Aubrey. Yes, exactly. All our English. Our team has an IELTS podcast and we have 14 years of examiner experience there. But there's also other things like college essays, applications, letters and recommendation. So how would you handle this, Michelle? How would you handle building a calendar for yourself in deadline? Yeah, well, how would I handle it? I mean, I would just have tons and tons of lists. Or maybe like a chalkboard.

0:06:06
Yeah, or a dry erase board where I had everything listed. I also like to do alarms in my phone on certain dates. So I would maybe you would color code something. I don't know. There are a lot of options. I think it's very personal to everybody. Yeah, I think the bottom line here is make this your business. Right. Make it your business and get accepted to a college that you love. That means you've got to have files, folders, Google Drive, Spreadsheets. Go for it, guys. Get organized. Because the number one skill that, you know, obviously you need to have to succeed in life is organizational skills. And if you can't even get into college, because you're not organized, things are not starting off well.

0:06:43
Right. Right. Right. Yes, you have to show that you're organized that you don't miss those deadlines. Exactly. And then the last one is a little more intangible, Michelle. What is this? All right. Well, this one is fine to the right fit. And this is also so important. I mean, guys, it's like maybe it sounds like a great school. Maybe you know the name. And it sounds perfect and everything. But it might just not be the right fit for you.

0:07:08
You have to think about what is going to suit you. Like, do you want a big school? Do you want a small school? What's your major? What's kind of the culture at the school? Do you want to typical college experience on a big college campus? Or do you want to be in a city? So many things to think about. Oh my gosh, it's so true. Because there's so many different schools in the US in the world that could have such different experiences. Like, for me, in my case, I thought I didn't really want the Greek life and want the big school. Although now that I think about it, I kind of wish I sort out of had that.

0:07:39
The big football games, the all the excitement that a big college brings. Do you feel like you made the you had the right fit in your college, Michelle? Yeah, I think overall. Like, there are some things like maybe in my major that like could have been maybe a little bit different. But overall, like, I'm happy where I went to school. I liked I liked having like that typical college experience. So I didn't do Greek like life or anything like that. But you know, it was fun to have the games and I lived in freshman and sophomore year. I lived right across from the stadium and to hear the songs. And so definitely I'm happy where I went to school. I did like my experience.

0:08:19
So fun. So fun. What is Greek life? By the way, for our listeners, before we finish up, I want to make sure they know that term that we just said. Greek life. What does that mean? Are we talking about Greek or German? For our audience. So these are like, you know, you have to kind of bid or whatever you call it or apply to get into them. It's basically like groups of friends and they call each other their brothers and sisters. And it's like a club. And people, people really love them. There's also a lot of problems that they can sometimes run into.

0:08:47
Yeah, I hate you. For example, right? The industry process of applying. Sometimes people are forced to do crazy things. It's yeah, there's a lot of controversy right now in the news about that too. But I think campuses are cracking down on initiation. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, the good thing about Greek life, I guess, I've never really been involved. But I guess you do have a close club and for networking for later in life, it may connect you to professional opportunities. Right?

0:09:13
Yes, there are a lot of benefits to it. So I didn't do it, but I know people who did it, and I loved it. Absolutely. So check that out, guys. But follow these three tips to make sure you are applying to the right place and that you're doing it in the right way. We're so excited to hear about your success, right, Michelle? That's right. That's right. All right, Lindsay, well, this has been fun. Guys, listen to us four days a week. Follow all of these English, and we will see you on the next one. We'll be back soon for more.
