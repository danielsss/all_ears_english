I've still failed at cooking almost every time I try to cook. When I cook chicken, it ends up being rubbery and all wilted on the ends, and I don't know how to fix that. I guess I do need to take a class, as you said, you're going to start taking cooking classes. I've failed in general at the household skills. Let's just say that. I don't want to fix the pie for you. I feel like I have found a tip that might help you, so try this, okay? This is a little cooking tip for everyone out there. Maybe all of our listeners know this, but I've discovered with chicken, it has to be fully defrosted. Don't try to cook it from frozen, and you have to pound it. You have to pound it. Whatever you're doing, whatever you cook, like grilling, if you don't, it's just never very good when you make it home. Okay, and then before I put it in the oven, right? You really are bad at cooking, let's be. I'm totally hungry. I want to check out that one. Yes, raw chicken. And this is tricky because you don't want to hit it and let juices fly all over the butter. You need to put something over it, like paper towels, wax paper, and you need that mallet that pounds it so that it ends up being very flat and the same width, I guess you'd say, throughout. That's the best way to cook chicken at home so that it's not dry where it's thin and still raw where it's fat.

0:03:10
God, so we're going for that consistency. Yeah, right. I'm waiting. Okay, thank you. I'm going to take that tip part of that. I'm going to try that. I'm going to try it again. You've got to keep trying at these things, Aubrey. What about you? Now, I've revealed my embarrassing tip. Is there anything that you feel like you've failed at? Anything? Oh, yes. I've kind of failed at piano. I took a lot of lessons as a kid and then I feel sort of like a failure because my parents invested money or actually my dad traded paintings for piano lessons, which was awesome. This is partying. He was able to do. But I spent a lot of time. I invested a lot of time taking all these lessons and I don't practice nearly as much as I should and it's going away. I'm losing that skill. So I sort of feel like a failure. Oh, okay, I see. Okay, well, I mean, to something, I mean, sometimes we have to decide whether to move on from something or to go back and try it again. So you're going to keep trying it or you're just going to move on and try other things. I am going to keep trying it. But I need to, I probably need to like take lessons again, get more serious about trying, find things I really enjoy practicing because otherwise, you know, I'll sit down and try to play a little bit. I got a book of Hamilton, like the score from Hamilton, the music. And that was really fun to sit down and play those melodies that I love and I'm familiar with. So that kind of got me excited about trying again.

0:04:26
I need to keep trying. So it's like finding the material that you, you know, that gets you excited about it. Yeah, and for me, I don't think I can move on from cooking. I'm going to have to eventually learn how to cook. So I'm going back with your tip to pound the chicken. I'm going for it. Okay. So today's episode guys is all about why it's actually important to have a history of failure. And I want to think of this as kind of building a failure muscle. Like you've learned how to fail because learning a language is actually a thousand failures in one day all the time, right? Aubrey, we're always failing when we're learning a language, but that's okay. Exactly right? We're going to make mistakes. And if we let that paralyze us, then we're never going to grow. We're never going to regret. We're not going to be willing to have that conversation with a native if we're so worried about making a grammar mistake. Exactly. So we have a quote to inspire you guys today. It's by Michael Jordan, the famous basketball player, one of the greatest basketball players of all time. Aubrey, could you read it for a listener so they can get inspired too? He said, I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. So good. Wow. That is so profound. If you think about it, I bet most average basketball players, they miss that game winning shot once and then they're done.

0:05:46
They quit. They move on baseball. That's not for them. Right? They move on in their mind. That's the end of it, but not Michael Jordan. Yes, he failed so many times. He tried so many times and he failed so many times. And I love how he recognizes that that is why he's successful. He kept at it. He was willing to make these failures, these mistakes and keep trying and know that he could do better. Exactly. And I was telling Aubrey when we first started recording, I mean, I have heard that in the venture capital world, you know, if you want to get funding for your idea, let's say you think you have the next Facebook or something. Investors really prefer to invest in people who have already started a company and that have failed. That company has failed, has closed down because they want to see that you know, they want to see that you've corrected your mistakes, you understand what works and what doesn't. Right? Yeah, but that's actually a thing. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, they're going to invest money. They want you know, to see that you have gone through this before. You know, not just that you know what you're doing, but that you've been able to fail and keep going. You're that type of person. Exactly. That's the key. This episode is brought to you by Collox Hill. For soft, comfy stores, you use Collox Hill with Center, the pink one that's soft and stools and encourages bound movement to give reliable and over night relief. It's Stefan with everything you need to know about stools. Now I don't want to push it, push it too hard, but I even made a Stefan stool playlist to help you get a good feeling.

0:07:14
So try Australia's number one constipation tablet brand Collox Hill. Soft and stools relieves constipation. Always read the label and follow the directions for use. So I feel like we want to put put for for listeners today a new metric and that metric is a number of mistakes we want you to make in a day. So that should be in a way we want to reverse our thinking. That's what we want to try to achieve. Oh, I love that idea. I'm totally going to do this in Spanish. Like I'm aiming for a certain amount of mistakes each day and if I do that then I've reached my goal. I know. I mean imagine how that would change all our lives. Not just learning English, but any goal parenting. I'm like I'm an aim for a certain amount of mistakes when I'm parenting. Exactly. Why not seeing them as successes? Totally. And it also helps you start to eliminate things and know what works. I mean, I'm doing a particular research project for us today this week for all our English and I'm getting a lot of nose, but the more nose I get the more I know I'm getting to my yeses eventually, right? What I'm researching, what I'm looking for. That's a good thing. So the nose are good. The failures are good. The mistakes are good. So you can find your way to the success, right? So this is a whole new way of seeing the world, isn't it, Aubrey? It really is, right? Think about what a positive spin this puts on it instead of getting down on yourself if you recognize a mistake that you make seeing it as a success because you tried because you're putting yourself out there, right? If you're speaking in English to a native or to someone else speaking English and you notice a few grammar mistakes, be excited about that because you're speaking to another person in English. You're getting closer. You're recognizing them. That's a win right there. And you're getting closer and closer to that native conversation.

0:08:53
Yeah. And you also just, like you said, you get more comfortable with seeing yourself make those mistakes the more you make them the easier it gets. And also we get to practice our muscle of focusing on connection, not perfection. This ties really into our vision here at all our English because the more times you make that mistake, then you turn your attention and you say, okay, yeah, I just made a grammar mistake, but guess what? I'm still making eye contact with this person. This person is still laughing at my jokes. So I have connected so I've won. Yes, exactly, right? I feel like when it comes to idiomatic language, so many language learners are really hesitant with idioms because they know it's easy to mess them up. You change one word and it's messed up so they don't try. But think about it as like try one. And if you recognize it's a mess that just laugh about it, turn it into a joke, you know, asking that you're talking to a native ask them if you used it correctly. It's fun. I love having that type of conversation with someone learning English. Oh my gosh. And it's so fun if we can laugh at ourselves. Oh gosh. I've got some great memories living in Japan and having some really good laughs with my friends, both my Japanese friends and my native English speaking friends about mistakes, like moments where maybe we walked into a bar and we said something really weird to the host and they just completely misunderstood and we laugh for hours about it, right? This is good stuff. This is stuff we remember at the end of our lives. It's a good stuff. Yes, exactly. I know I've told you a story before about French when I've said something just that enough of a wrong intonation accent on something that I told someone I hope they have death in their home instead of love. I'm like, oh, man, it doesn't get that we laughed about it, right? They kind of pointed out and laughed and ended up being a really funny memory.

0:10:33
That's hilarious. There are so many endless stories and you guys can have these stories. You can choose how to react to them. You can enjoy the moment, build a connection with whoever you're with, making that mistake, or you can curl up and you can separate yourself from the world. I'd rather do the first one that I mentioned, right? The former, as I meant. Yeah, so guys, make sure you just make as many mistakes as you can in a day. That's a takeaway for today, Aubrey. What do you think? Yes, I agree. I love it. I aim for as many mistakes as possible because that's going to push you to be making those connections, which is the goal. Aubrey, I'm so good. So guys, in the next episode, we're going to talk a little bit about how to send, how to end your emails. We're going back to the business world now in the next one and talk about how to end your email. So I cannot wait for that one and Michelle, I'll talk to you. Sorry, Michelle. No, you're not a kind of. I'm not a kind of. Because I love Michelle so much. You can call me Michelle. Doesn't offend me. You guys, no, Michelle, she'll be back in future episodes. But we're so excited to have Aubrey on the show these days, the last couple of episodes. So Aubrey, I'll see you in the next one. Yeah, bye. Thanks for listening to all ears English.
