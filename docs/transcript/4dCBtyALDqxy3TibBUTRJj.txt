0:01:39You know, sometimes I feel like what should I say? How can I... I don't know, just sort of a little uncomfortable at times. One of the other things I say is that if I'm the other person too, right? I guarantee that with some people, you're comfortable, everything's natural, and then just handing on the other person and sort of their cues or the way they are sometimes it does. Yeah, that little awkward you don't know what to say next. You're right. Sometimes that person is actually uncomfortable and awkward. Therefore, you feel uncomfortable and awkward, but it's not you, it's them. It's not you, it's me. It's not me, it's you. So today guys and today's episode, what do we have for our listeners, Aubrey? Yeah, so we're going to give you guys a cultural tip for conversational English. And here it is, if someone asks how you're doing, you can just say, you know, I'm doing well, I'm doing great, okay? And if you don't know this person well, maybe there's a tendency for a little bit of awkwardness. You can always talk about the weather. It's never weird. People talk natives talk about the weather all the time. Yeah, and I know this is so common. I mean, we kind of laughed about this and we thought, you know, is this what we wanted to teach our listeners today. But the truth is, I do this all the time. I mean, I've had numerous conversations with companies this week and the conversation has started off about the weather. So we actually do it. We do it. We do it all the time over on the Outer Energy Podcast.

0:03:01I know Jessica and I often are mentioning how hot it is in Portland or Arizona. It just comes up all the time, conversations with friends, conversations at work. It's just something people talk about a lot. It's ever present and you know you have that in common. There might be a lot of things you don't know what you have common ground on. The current weather you have in common. Exactly. Exactly. And I know this is also really common in British English because there's some rainy weather there. And I've just heard that that's something they tend to do in British English as well as American English, Australian English. I'm not sure. You'll have to ask an Aussie, right? But so, I mean, let's give our listeners a couple of examples. Then, Aubrey, let's improvise here a little bit. Guys, today's episode is totally spontaneous. I mean, this is not pre-plan for you. We're giving you real, real English. Yes. And I think you could still be kind of awkward about this if you're like, I'm doing well, what do you think about the weather? There's just something strange, but there are native phrases that lead into it supernaturally. So, we're going to share those with you guys today so that you know how to lead into chatting about the weather. Yeah. And I think we're really good and we're going to talk about this verb to get, right? Aubrey, a little bit here.

0:04:15I think this is a great one to lean on because you're talking about in the passive form. You can ask the person a question. Do you think we're going to get rain later? Yes, exactly. Or talk about the current situation by saying, can you believe all this heat we're getting? Yeah, I think so. Or can you believe all this snow we're getting? Do you think we're going to get more snow tomorrow I'm done? Or, for example, I was on a call with someone in New York today and I said, I could say, oh, did you get that same heat wave that we got here in Colorado or in Boston, for example? Right? Yes, asking about weather patterns. I know here in the mountain west we got a lot of the, there were wildfires in the Pacific Northwest, right? And they kind of traveled the air, traveled across the country. So I could say, are you getting this bad air from the Pacific Northwest? So you could go beyond just the weather, it could be air quality, it could be lots of things. And again, it seems cheesy, but it's so common. This episode is brought to you by Collox Hill. For soft comfy stoos, you use Collox Hill with Santa, the pink one that softened stoos and encourages bowel movement to give reliable love and night relief. It's Stefan with everything you need to know about stoos. Now I don't want to push it, push it too hard. But I've even made a Stefan stool playlist to help you get a good feeling. So try Australia's number one conservation tablet brand Collox Hill. Softened stoos relieves constipation. Always read the label and follow the directions for use. It's so common. It's very natural. You guys, if you haven't noticed it before, you're going to start noticing it now.

0:05:48One of those things, once you name it, you see it everywhere. If you're even dropping on someone's conversation, you're going to hear them talk about the weather. Right. And we've made that suggestion to use Drop as a strategy in a last episode before in a past episode, right? Right, Aubrey? Yes, exactly. It's a good strategy. All right. So here's my question to you as a native speaker Aubrey. Now how long do you expect the weather dance to go with the person? Obviously, you're not going to sit there and talk about the weather for half an hour. What is it okay to transition into the business at hand? Yeah, I think two or three sentences at the most, you're going to ask them something, right? You always want to be asking them what they think about something. Don't just talk about the weather you are, right? You could say, yeah, can you believe this rain we're getting? And then they will respond, right? Something interesting about the rain, where they are, maybe they'll ask you a question. And then after a couple of sentences, you can transition into, especially if you're in a meeting and time is money, right? Yeah. But even if you're chatting with a friend, right? You can move on pretty quickly to talk about something else. Yeah. And there's always, I think we should do an episode about this someday, Aubrey, there's always a very predictable pause, especially in the business context when you're working with a coworker, maybe, where you're both ready to move into the point of the meeting. Why you're talking? And I just, I think this is probably different across cultures. What do you think, Aubrey? You know, the way this works. Yeah, I'm sure this is different across cultures. But yeah, for, in the United States, for sure, you'll have, there's a little bit of small talk, a little bit of chit chat. And then what happens is, instead of asking a follow up question, someone might just pause. There's just this tiniest bit of silence, and you can recognize that as your cue to jump right into the matter at hand.

0:07:31Exactly. I love it. And in American English, we do speak in, I guess, kind of a linear way, right? It's a personality thing too. But culturally, you know, we want to get to that as Aubrey said, time is money. In business, we want to get to the point quickly. So make sure you look for those cues from the person. If you're in the business world, right? As many of you guys are, you've got to be ready to go into it when the person is ready. Okay. Don't delay. Exactly. Right. There's nothing more awkward than, you know, they don't ask you a follow up question about the weather. They kind of pause expecting you to go into. Okay. Let's talk about the agenda and you continue talking about the weather or something. And it's just going on a little too long. This, this is where it's problematic, right? You really need to practice this. Pay attention to how others do it so that you can very natively and naturally transition into, you know, what you need to be talking about. Exactly. I mean, that's what we love to focus on in this show. Aubrey is how to help you guys connect at that higher level of English. You have vocabulary. You're good to go. You have the basics of English, but now how do you build the connections in the relationships by reading between the lines? Right? Reading, what does this person really want to talk about now at this point? What do I say? That's the guy that's read their social cues. Yeah. Pay attention to their body language. Their face is doing. You're going to feel it. You're going to feel that shift to now. We're ready to talk about business. I love it. I love it. It's all about how you build those relationships and business. And before we finish up today, I want to make sure our listeners know we have another podcast. What's it called, Aubrey?
