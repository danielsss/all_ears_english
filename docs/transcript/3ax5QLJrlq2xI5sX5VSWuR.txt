0:01:35Awesome. I want to start off with an interesting question for today's episode and that is when do you think our listeners should study English? Should they study in the morning, the afternoon or the evening? What do you think? That's a great question and I think it's a very personal question to be honest. I don't know what there's one answer for everybody. I think you have to know yourself. For me, you know me. I'm more of an evening person, but the problem for evening people is you don't always want to study in the evening because that's the evening. It's kind of tricky, but you have to know where your strengths lie, right? How do you work around that? Because I know Michelle, we have recorded podcasts all different times. Sometimes we record in the morning, we've done a few episodes here. We record in the morning, we record in the evening. I know you're usually more on in the evening, like you said, more energy, but sometimes you have to work in the morning. How do you deal with that? How do you wake yourself up? Coffee, man. That's all. I can't. The evening people, we have to kind of work around the rest of society because it is such a morning culture. There's really nothing. Unfortunately, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. But as far as our listeners, I just think it's you have to know yourself, you have to know your schedule. I don't think that there's one best time. What do you think, Lindsay?

0:02:52Yeah. I agree. I was just going to ask you real quick. Were you that way in college, too? Were you that bad kid that was up late setting at 2 a.m. when you were in college? I'm curious. You know what? I don't remember. I don't remember. I do remember once staying up very, very late. But the thing I could never do was pull. I only did one all nighter and like as much as I can stay up late, I cannot just like then stay up all night and then go directly into a test. Like that, I couldn't do that. Yeah. So that's a great phrase for our listeners, a bonus phrase for today, guys, to pull in all nighter. I think we've talked about this before, but what does that mean, Michelle? To stay up all night and not go to sleep. Usually before some sort of test or something. Oh, I feel awful when I do that. I've never done that either, Michelle. But yeah, so I just wondered if your habits have changed as an adult or whether you were the same way. If this is true, our whole lives. But in terms of my answer, my opinion on this, I think it's very personal, too. For me, I'm the opposite of you. I'm a morning person. And for me, it comes down to willpower. You know, I found this great quote on medium.com, which says that willpower is the ability to resist short-term temptations in order to meet long-term goals. So what that means for me is that willpower is a muscle. It runs out. So I start the morning so strong, feeling so good, so clear, so much energy and mind power and willpower. But by three or four, I'm checking my email, I'm checking Facebook. I'm just, I'm losing it. So for me, if I were trying to study English, like our listeners, I would definitely get to it right away in the morning. It would be the first thing I would do in the morning. What do you think about that, Michelle?

For soft, comfy stoos, you use Colloxil with center, the pink one that softens stoos and encourages bowel movement to give reliable low-venight relief. It's Stefan with everything you need to know about stoos. Now I don't want to push it, pushing too hard. But I even made a Stefan stool playlist to help you get good feeling. So try Australia's number one constipation tablet brand Colloxil. Stool relieves constipation. Always read the label and follow the directions for use. Yeah, I mean, I think that that's good. I think you know yourself, you know, and I think yeah, when you are going to have that burst of willpower, that's when that's when you're going to be the most productive, right? Now, sometimes it doesn't work out for our lives, right? Like you can't like, yeah, like I can't just like work every night at like 11 p.m. You know, when I might have the most willpower, then because I'm the type of person, like you just see us today, I was like, I was exhausted all day, exhausted. And it's finally time to get into bed. And I'm like, you know what, I feel better. That's so crazy. That's so crazy that you get that burst of energy at 11 p.m. Dude, so like I always have to scrunch myself into, you know, a real life schedule. So, you know, sometimes that willpower doesn't always coincide with like real life. So you kind of have to find that mix between like when is like the best time for you and when it can you be most realistic. And you know, only you can answer that for yourself.

0:05:57Yeah, I think that's so true. Michelle, I've heard in the past that a lot of creative types, your creative type for sure. You know, you do music, you do acting, a lot of them do come alive at night. I've heard that in different places for sure. So that makes total sense for you. But yeah, the world is kind of a little bit against you a little bit in this way, right? We show up at work early in the morning. We're expected to be on at 9 a.m. So who knows, maybe things will change in the future. But guys, the point is, I mean, what is the takeaway, Michelle, here, when it comes to study English, when should they study? When should our listeners study English? What's the takeaway? I think the takeaway is know yourself. Yes. And really like don't try and fit yourself into unless, you know, such vegetables you have to. But like really try your best to like study. Even if it's not like strict studying at a certain time, like maybe, okay, for me, like if I were studying a language, and it's like 11 p.m. and I finally feel alive. And like I'm like ready to go, but it's time to go to sleep. You know, maybe, okay, fine, maybe like I wind down with like, you know, five new words. And I just like, you know, it's kind of something that I can look forward to. Like when I'm relaxing or something like that. So make it fun. You know, know when you are going to have that burst of willpower. And even if it's not like the time of day that goes along with the rest of the world, like you can still do something like still like kind of try and soak up that, you know, energy that you have and use it in some way. Even if it's just a little bit because that even a little bit helps. I love that so good. I love it. Know yourself. That is the key right there Michelle.

0:07:29All right. Well, that's it for today. Thanks for hanging out. It's been an interesting topic for sure. Definitely love it. Have a good one. Let's talk to you soon. Bye. Bye.
