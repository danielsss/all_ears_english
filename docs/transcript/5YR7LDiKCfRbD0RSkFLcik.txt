This is an all-years English podcast episode 53, why you must overshoot your English goals to achieve them. Welcome to the all-years English podcast where you'll finally get real, native English conversation and fluency for business and life. We believe in connection, not perfection, when it comes to learning English. Now here are your hosts, Lindsay McMan, the English adventurer and Michelle Kaplan, the New York radio girl, coming to you from Boston and New York City, USA. What is your English goal for this year? In this episode, learn what you must do when you set your goals in order to make sure you reach them. Listen in today. Hey Michelle, are you feeling inspired today? I'm always feeling inspired when I get on the mic with you Lindsay. Oh my God, that's so good to know. We love that morning. We love being here for you guys. Yeah, you know, I've been thinking a lot Michelle about setting goals. And when we set goals, what is something important that we have to think about when we set our English goals or our fitness goals or any kind of goal in life? We want to think about being inspired and we want to think about kind of doing like almost setting our goals higher to be able to achieve what we want. Does that make sense? Exactly. And you assume that you're not going to quite hit that, but it's a stretch goal and stretch goals are good. I mean our goals should be big. They should scare off. Yeah, exactly. They should scare us guys. So they should motivate us and scare us a little bit. So, um, Lindsay, do we want to share a quote? Yeah, guys, this is all about getting inspiration from famous thinkers in history. And this quote is from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Okay. And here is the quote. If you would hit the mark, you must aim a little above it. Every arrow that flies feels the attraction of earth. That's interesting. So I think by that, he means Michelle. Every arrow that goes up kind of gets pulled down by gravity.

Is that right? Yeah, that's what it sounds like to me. Right. Right. Right. So I mean, a common example of this is, you know, in the business world businesses will set their revenue goals higher than they think they're, you know, are actually going to do. Right. So that they are doing big things to get there. So you're probably going to fall short of that maybe by 10 or 15%. But that's okay. Cause we assume that when we set those revenue goals, right? Right. Right. Right. Right. But like, do you think like if by setting that and you know that you're setting it high, yeah, yeah, you. It's like, can you still kind of fool yourself? Do you think? Yeah, that's a good question. Michelle, right. You can, you can, you can, yeah, beyond to yourself. I figure out what you're doing. That's a good question. Well, I think just by setting that, you, there is some integrity. You want to be in integrity with that goal. That just means it's more about, it's not so much about the number at that point about what are the actions that I'm taking. I have to take big action to get there. Right. And then we assume some of these things are not going to work. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Interesting. Yeah. You know what this actually makes me think of an analogy. It's not quite the same, but it's in that music analogy. Yeah. So when I was in chorus in high school, I remember my teacher, you know, I mean, you would know the words sharp and flat. Yeah. I remember because I played the clarinet. Oh, you played that. Okay. So, so like a lot of times she would tell us that when we were singing, to actually to avoid being flat, which is a little bit under the note to, right, like a little bit like to you're falling short of the note, to avoid being doing that. Actually, aiming a little bit above the note. And instead of aiming for the note, because I guess it sounds like a long fellow thing, like it's going to get pulled down a little bit. In your mind, in your mind, you're actually aiming to be a little bit higher than the note, but then it naturally becomes lower. So I always remember that. And sometimes still when I sing, I think about that. And this kind of just reminds me of this quote of this idea of like shooting for a little bit higher and knowing that it's going to be, you know, then to try and get to your goal.

Interesting. And what is it, just a technical question? What is it that brings it down? Is this singing Michelle or is this on an instrument or both? I'm thinking about singing. I don't know. With an instrument, it... I mean, I guess some instruments in my work, but I'm thinking more for singing. So would it be like maybe the acoustics of the room that could bring it down, that kind of thing, the air, the time of day, that sort of thing that would bring it down? I'm not really sure. I'm not really sure. I'm not sure exactly what brings it down, but I think it's just if you're... I think it's more about... Maybe I'm wrong, but I think it's more about just changing your mindset and your aiming higher, because it's a common thing to fall a little bit under the note. So if you try to go over it, you're kind of... You're consciously aware of that and just going a little bit higher so that you aren't going too low. I love that. That's a great example. Absolutely. That makes total sense. And so guys, we've given you some examples in business, in music, and then if you think about for your life learning to speak English, we know that you want to push ahead to that advanced level. Our listeners are intermediate, to upper intermediate, English language learners. You want to push higher. I like to set goals based on actions. What are the actions I'm going to take? So I say I'm going to listen to 200 minutes of English a week. And then that's a really high goal. That's a lot of time. Maybe I know I'm going to just do 180 in general, but if I'm doing 180, I'm already doing really well. I'm on my way to fluency.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, very good point, Lindsey. Yeah, that is so good. So guys, think right now we want you to think what is your goal? And where do you want to be within the next six months and then set the benchmark a little bit higher? Make sure it's measurable. Make sure that you can see if you achieved it or not. Right? That's huge. Yeah, it's a number. It's an amount of time. It's the number of actions that you're taking and then set it just a little bit higher. Exactly. Exactly. Okay, you guys can do it. This is going to be awesome. Yeah, you have the ability. You can do it. I'm giving you a pep talk. This is awesome.
