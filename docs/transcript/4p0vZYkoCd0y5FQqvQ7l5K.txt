Hey, Lindsay, good, good, how are you? Oh my gosh, I am happy to be on the mic as always with you and Michelle. It's almost Christmas time. Yeah. That's right. It's a very exciting time of the year, guys, in the US. Oh my gosh. Is there anything you're so crazy, but it's so much fun. It is so crazy.

0:01:54Is there anything that's going to be different about your Christmas this year, anything notable that's going to stand out for you, Michelle? I don't know, hopefully. Just enjoying the season, hanging out with family and friends. What about you? Yeah, I mean, I enjoy, yeah. It's a family time that's huge for me. And now, I don't see my parents very often, but when I do, I just want to enjoy with them. You know, I just want to, yeah, for sure. So I'm looking forward to that. But I also love the hot chocolate and whipped cream, hot chocolate with whipped cream. What do you think about that? Oh, I love that too. I love the Christmas music. I love, especially in New York.

0:02:32I mean, Christmas is so great. Seeing the big tree and all the lights and the music just playing everywhere. It's just, I do love that season. Oh my gosh. That's a great time. Have you ever been ice skating in Rockefeller Center? I have. Oh, that is so classic. Such a classic New York activity. I mean, tourists come to New York from all over the world to enjoy New York at Christmas time. Yeah, I did. That was my second date with my husband. Really no wonder you guys got married. That's so romantic.

0:03:00It wasn't around Christmas, though. It was like in March, probably. It's still out though. It's still cold. That's not a bad date. Did he plan that date or did you plan it? Yeah, he did. Yeah, he did. He did. He showed up with T. It was very nice. Oh, that's so cute. That's so cute. I love it. I love it.

0:03:20He's a keeper, right? As we say, he's a keeper. He's a keeper. Very great. Cool. So in this episode, guys, we are here to let you know what you can do. If you are enjoying the Christmas holiday in the United States, these are things you can do. And the first one is Michelle. We already touched on it. Yeah. Go ice skating, guys. Yeah. I know you are. You can go to Central Park.

0:03:43Rockefeller Center, Bryant Park. I love Bryant Park. Yeah. I thought we also did ice skating there, too. Do you prefer Bryant Park over Rockefeller Center? Is it a little less touristy or what should we get? I would say they're both pretty touristy. Pretty touristy. Yeah, but this was fun. I mean, if it's touristy, that's fine. It's like one of those things where it's kind of you expected to be touristy. Yeah, it's kind of magical. It's kind of magical. Yeah. When I lived in New York, I used to have lunch in Bryant Park a lot because I was always in Midtown, running uptown, downtown, stopped there for lunch and just like pinch yourself and say, oh my gosh, I'm in New York.

0:04:20So amazing. I know Bryant Park is definitely one of my favorite places. Yeah. Because it's just city park. It's almost like the city encroaches on the park. It's like right in the library there. I love the whole thing. Yeah, Bryant Park is always, I go there pretty frequently. Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. So what's another thing you can do in the US? For Christmas. Well, you'll probably, you may be invited to a company Christmas party. If you are living in the US, you're working here, you're not heading back home.

0:04:49And I'm sure we could do another episode another day on how to handle a company holiday Christmas party. Yeah. Right? Lots of do-then-dones there, guys. But if you do get invited, make sure you go. Right? Right. Yeah, it's fun. I remember going in. They have all these giveaways, and I remember once I won a Kindle. Oh, is this for your radio job? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fun.

0:05:16It's a fun time of year. You bond with your coworkers in a different kind of way. Definitely. And sometimes you might go out with them after. They're my dinner after party. Guys, go to these events. Even if you know that you're not going to understand 100% of what your coworkers are saying, just go. Just show up. It's like FaceTime. You put in the FaceTime. Give me a app on Facebook, right? Exactly. Yeah, it's a lot of fun. I mean, and then along with that, I mean, just going to any sort of cocktail party.

0:05:43Yeah. I mean, you know, at this time of year is, you know, even if it's not with your company, just with friends or networking or anything, it's just fun. It's a good time. Exactly. And I think we have a couple of tips. If you are going to a cocktail party, two tips, guys. Number one, you should bring something. Okay. So bring a bottle of wine, bring a dessert. Ask the host ahead of time what should you bring. Don't show up empty handed to any party, and especially not a fancy cocktail party around the holidays. Right. Right.

0:06:15Right. Exactly. That's a very good tip, Lindsay. Yeah. And how should we dress, Michelle, when we go to a cocktail party in New York? Is it more fancy or is it just jeans? I mean, what are we wearing at a cocktail party? I think it kind of depends. But generally, I guess, when you use the word cocktail party, it implies some sort of fancy mess. So dress up a little bit, whatever that means to you. Yeah, I would say definitely dress up. Cocktail party is different from a backyard barbecue, okay? In terms of what you would wear. These happen in the winter, mostly only.

0:06:49And there are cocktail dresses that you can get. If you're a woman, there's an actual cocktail dress. It's a style of dress. So just don't show up in jeans. I'm going to say that's our advice for you guys. And what's a fourth thing, Michelle, that our listeners could do around the holidays? Well, you can go to a Christmas tree lighting. It doesn't have to be in New York, at the Rockefeller Christmas tree lighting, although that is a giant one. But I know Lindsay, you, when you left in Boston, you go in the Boston Common. Yeah, for sure. And then I remember when I was a kid growing up in Little Old Key, New Hampshire, we used to have first night, I don't know, that was sorry, that was New Year's, but we used to go to the tree lighting and it was a fun family thing. So if your family is here with you in the US, take your family with you.

0:07:31Get some hot chocolate for them, make it an evening out. Sometimes you'll find food vendors and things, right? Yeah, yeah. It is a fun time to go to something like that. It's very special. Yeah. And then I love this last one, which is volunteer your time. This is a great time of year to give something back. So you could go to a soup kitchen volunteer, you know, serving food to homeless people on Christmas. And I mean, as a bonus, as a bonus that can help you also practice your English, get to know the people who are also volunteering, you know, speaking with other people. So that's a good idea as well. Yeah, and we have done an episode on that before. So come back to allersenglish.com and search for that guys.

0:08:16You know, and when you do this, this could be a great way to kick off a new activity that's permanent for you. So start it in the holidays and then continue it every week for the whole year. That's really cool. Yeah. And really see as an improvement in your English, right, Michelle? Absolutely. Absolutely. Good thing to start giving back. All right. Awesome.
