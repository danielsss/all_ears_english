So definitely subscribe all-ears English so that you'd never miss an episode. Love it. So Aubrey, you've spent a lot of time learning languages. I mean, I could tell from your accent that you're pretty fluent in French. Is that right? Yes, correct. I'm fluent in French. I taught college French for a while before I had twins and was too busy to do that. Wow. So I taught English and French and I'm learning Spanish as well, which I love. And yeah, yeah. I would speak. Yeah. I would speak. Oh my gosh. Okay. So I have learned Japanese. When I lived in Japan, I studied Japanese. I took the famous test for foreigners and I did pass at that level I was going for. But now, you know, it's so sad if we don't maintain our languages. I've learned French, definitely not fluent. I am more, most fluent in Spanish, but I'm losing it quickly. My accent's going away. It's very, very bad. You have to use it. That's such a good point. Like everyone listening to this podcast, you guys are aware of that. That's why you're listening to a podcast like this. If you don't listen to it, if you don't use it, it goes away. Exactly. And that's why we're here. You know, on this show guys, we like to give you tips on how to learn best because we all have this experience in learning languages and we know what works. And today, we're going to give you one tip that may sound a little weird. Some of our tips are kind of strange on this show. Like a few episodes ago, we talked about how you should call customer service to practice your English. Kind of weird, but it works. Okay. Yeah. So today, what is that weird tip that we're going to offer? Our tip is that you should change the place where you study. Goes the more interesting go to a cafe. And this is the weird part is that you can even stop and just listen to the conversations of people around you. Exactly. And why would you study in your room when there's nothing in the background? So when we bring our books and our stuff to a cafe, now your material is what's around you.

0:03:47Is the table behind you? It's ease dropping. What does ease dropping mean? I mean, to listen to the conversations near you. This is very easy to do in the United States because people often speak very loudly. Yeah, they're not always really considerate of the person at the next table who might not want to hear their conversation. But for this tip, that's perfect because without making it obvious, you're going to be able to hear their conversation very clearly. Yeah. And this word, by the way, we talk a little bit about spelling on those shots. It's very weirdly spelled. Right. We spell it. E-A-V-E-S drop. Eaves drop. And so, Aubrey, when you were living in Belgium, right? Yes. Yes. Did you do this? I mean, come on. And then you probably did. I totally did. I would go to an internet cafe. This was a little while ago where people, most people didn't have internet in their homes. And so I would go to this cafe where I could email my family and friends. And I was always ease dropping on the conversations of people who were there drinking coffee because I just wanted to hear more French. And often in Belgium, at least, a lot of the conversations you would hear would be in Flemish. And so I had to kind of proactively, like I would proactively sit near someone that I could hear with speaking French. I was very intentionallyaves dropping. Yeah. I love that. And I've done it too. In Japan, I used to do this whenever I was, I guess, at a restaurant. Not so much on the train because in Japan, the train people don't talk a lot. They either have headphones on or they're reading a magazine or they're sleeping. Honestly, that is the most of the time. But depending on where you are, if you're in New York City, doing this on the train would be a great way to study. Yeah, exactly. Because if two friends are together, they're probably going to be chatting. Someone alone will still just be listening to their beer pubs. But on the train, if two people are chatting, just sit next to them. They don't care. Yeah, completely. So this is actually it's free. It's simple. It's easy. And we already kind of do it as human beings. I kind of do this sometimes. I'm just interested in people. I think human beings are interested in other people. So we kind of want to know what's going on in people's lives and get a barometer. What's their life like? What am I doing? Who am I in the world? Right? How we know is by comparison to other people. So all we're asking you to do is do this in your second language. Right? Exactly. Yeah. And this is where you're going to hear real native natural conversation because honestly a lot of podcasts are scripted and you maybe have noticed that. Like, oh, it sounds like this person's reading that does happen a lot. We don't. We don't script. We don't. But a lot of people do. And so it's not as native natural, maybe not as fast as natives really talk. So when you're eavesdropping, that's a native natural conversation. That's someone's English. Just like they do in their normal life. They're not slowing down for you to understand. They're using all kinds of vocabulary. So it's a great place to overhear that. Yeah. And don't worry if you don't get every word that is not the point. It's tuning your ear to things and learning for free. Right? I mean, this is how we do it. Right? So I mean, that's really the tip for today. I'll be any final takeaway for a list. Well, I'm so curious about this in other cultures because as an American, someone living in the United States, this is not taboo. Right? If someone is kind of sitting near me and I can sort of tell their overhearing my conversation, I'm not worried about it. I don't think that's embarrassing for them or me. I would never get up and leave. But I am curious if in other cultures, that is the case. So it would be interesting for you listening. Depending on where you are in the world, you probably know you know wherever you're living. If you get that feeling from people, oh, you know, I should leave two seats between me, between people or whatever the case. Right?

0:07:28So definitely sort of be aware of the culture, maybe talk you a few natives and ask them like, would this be strange for people if they felt like I was sitting close enough to listen? I can tell you in the United States. It's not. You can do that. It's not weird. And yeah, exactly. This is very cultural potentially and keep it broad. Right? You're just going to sit in there. You're listening not just to one conversation, maybe multiple conversations. And it's not like you're going to follow them. Right? No. It's not like you're talking about that. You know, that kind of thing. We're not talking about that. Right? Yeah. It's this is purely input. It's just natural input that we all want to get to get better at English. I love it. So guys, let us know if you've tried this. It's a little weird, but it does work. We've both seen it. And in the next episode, guys, we're going to talk about when is the best time to start studying English. So make sure you go immediately to the very next episode and follow all ears English. Right? Aubrey? Yes. Exactly. All right. I'll see you next time. All right. Take care. Bye. Bye. Thanks for listening to all ears English.
