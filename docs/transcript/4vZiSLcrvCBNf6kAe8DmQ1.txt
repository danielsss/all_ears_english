If you think that in China, they have a Valentine's Day somewhere in the summertime, in late summer and August or something like that, so it's really interesting. It's an art culture, but we know that love is cultural around the world. You guys celebrate different days, different holidays for love. Today we're talking about Valentine's Day in the US, in English speaking cultures, but to talk about this, we need to talk about some very clear English vocabulary phrases for our listeners. Exactly. He's a good one. The first one is to catch a movie. That's a different way of saying, see a movie. It's kind of a cool natural say. I'm just going to say, why would I say catch a movie instead of go see a movie or watch a movie? What do you think, Michelle? Why would you say catch a movie? It sounds cool, I agree with you, but how's the meaning changing here? It's like we're taking it in. I don't know. I'm trying to think exactly. Just another way of saying it. Do you have any ideas on this one? If you're inviting someone out, you have a crush on. You like this person. I think, hey, you want to catch a movie. It feels like it's almost a cliche, but it's okay to use it. It feels very casual.

0:03:00
You could also say, hey, do you want to go see a movie with me, but it feels a little less forward in my mind when I say catch a movie. It feels casual. Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense. Yeah, I do want to catch a movie. That sounds very casual. It sounds very good for like, datey stuff. Right, datey stuff. I just want to say, because our listeners, you guys are at this level. You are ready for this. Michelle, what's the difference between go catch a movie? Let's go see a movie and let's watch a movie. Yeah, what are you asking me? I'm asking you. Catching a movie is going out, watching a movie sounds like you're staying in. Exactly. That's such an important differentiator. I would say some of the main things. You guys need to know this. If someone invites you to a movie, you need to know whether they're saying, should we go to the movie theater together or do you want to come to my house and watch a movie together? Exactly. Important distinction there. You know what the person is asking. Right, right, right. And then the next phrase for our listeners, guys, make sure you're writing these down. This is gold for talking about love and Valentine's Day. It is to be a perfect match. Right. I love this one. This is very used very frequently. Michelle, would you say that you and your husband are a perfect match? I think we're a perfect match. I mean, obviously every... I don't know if there is such thing as a completely perfect match, but I would say we're a perfect match. Sure. I'm going to say that. I mean, not everyone finds that perfect match in their lifetime. So if you do find it, you should hang on to it, celebrate it, enjoy it, cultivate that relationship. The phrase is to be a perfect match. The idea to be meant for someone romantically. You have moments where you feel like that person was just meant for you. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you get along really well. Yeah, okay. Michelle, now the next one is all about the dating game. With the American Express Platinum Card, you could get used to this. Here is your Roy's Dark Soup with bamboo shoots and shiitake mushrooms. Enjoy it.

And this. Or exactly like the beef in porn sauce with garlic rice. I should give you some. And this. One a petito with up to $400 annual dining credit.

To play hard to get. This is really... this is a fun one. So yeah, it makes it's like when you seem like you're not interested in someone, but you're actually doing it so that the person will want to be with you more. Like, you know, you always want you went what you can't have. So if you play a little hard to get sometimes, people have this feeling that people... The other person will be more interested. Yeah, that's right or not. Rather, that's right or not. Do you think it works? I think there is something to it on a sleep. I think it's good too. Yeah. I mean, whether that's a good thing or a bad thing or what does that say about us, but I think that there's something to play hard to get. I think there's something to it. It's human psychology. You know, people want what they think they can have. So I think it's okay to do a little bit of this. It's also, you know, when you just start dating someone, you have your own life. For you have your friends, you're busy. So you're not available all the time and you shouldn't be available all the time.

0:06:29
Exactly. For some reason. So sometimes you can just do this naturally if you have a full life and you should. But then you've got to be careful because you've got another person. Know what's going to turn them off or turn them on. Right? You don't want to be too much of this. Yeah, and then have the person be like, forget it. This person doesn't like me. Exactly. That could backfire. And that's a good phrase for listeners too to backfire. Yeah. What if that means you're going to go back in the wrong direction? You mean to have something happen that will be good for you, but it goes wrong. It goes wrong. You think it's the right thing to do, but it ends up harming you and hurting your situation. So guys, that is the phrase to play hard to get. Michelle, one more for our listeners before we finish up for today. The next one is to go out on the town. And there's another way of saying to go out at night to do something on a date, see a movie, have dinner, go dancing, whatever it is. You can say, let's go out on the town. It's kind of broad. It could mean a lot of different things. Yeah, and this is good. You know, you tell you hear couples that are maybe married, have kids. They talk about having a date night once a week where they go out on the town. I feel like that's such a good thing, right? To make sure you keep the romance alive, keep the spark.

0:07:38
Yeah, yeah. It is. It is. Yeah. So to go out on the town, it's not like, oh, I'm going out on the town because I'm going grocery shopping tonight. It's like doing something exciting, something different. Exactly. Exactly. You got it, Michelle. So guys, now you have four supernatural and native phrases you can use.
