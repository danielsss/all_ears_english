Oh my gosh, happy New Year to you. Do you generally like to celebrate New Year's Eve or do you prefer to stay home? Actually, that's another question.

0:01:45Both. I love celebrating New Year's Eve, but I do prefer to do it at home. But I love to have friends over and play games. We try to play as many games as we can before we bring in the New Year. I love that. I love that. You are a big games person. And I hope that at some point we'll be able to play trivia with our listeners on this show someday. That would be so cool. That would be so cool. But guys, in the last episode, episode 30, Aubrey and I talked about New Year's Eve in New York City. Today, we're going to show you how to extend that conversation with a native speaker. What is the key vocab you would need to have a conversation with a native about New Year's, right, Aubrey? Exactly. The first one you just heard me use, actually, when I said, when I ring in the New Year, this is a fun expression to talk about celebrating the beginning of a New Year. So you might ask somebody, how are you going to ring in the New Year this year? When I hear ring, I think of a bell. Do you think of a bell like to ring a bell for sure? I think this is a very... I mean, it's common, but it's also a very traditional thing to say. To ring in the New Year, don't you think? Yes. I feel like it's used almost exclusively to talk about the New Year. We don't say, how are you going to ring in Christmas? We don't. We just use it for the New Year. Maybe that's because it's so monumental. It's so big that it's a New Year's starting, maybe making some goals, some resolutions, so we talk about ringing it in, making a big deal about it. I love that. That's such a good idea. And then we have this next word for you guys. I hope you are writing these down because you don't want to miss this vocabulary. It's gold here. So we have the word iconic. Now, when I think of iconic, I think of something that's an icon. Something is very typical. I mean, we talked in the last episode about New Year's Eve in Times Square, being pretty iconic, right, Aubrey? Yes, exactly, right. That ball dropping in Times Square is iconic. You probably have heard the word icon used to talk about some celebrities, sorry, or musicians. That is sort of an icon, sort of an example for a certain style or genre. And it's the same with landmarks like this. Let's say it's an icon. If you see it, you think of a particular city or place. Let me ask you a question. When you think of Boston, Aubrey, what do any icons come to mind? I'm curious.

0:04:05Yes, yeah. So when I went to Boston, there was like the, there's old iron sides, right? I think of that ship. And then I'm trying to know the names of them, but the big markets. Is it just Boston market? Where are the shops by the water? Oh, a fan you'll hallmark a place is what you're talking about. Yeah, that is iconic. That is iconic for sure. And then there's the cheers bar. Right. I don't know if you use it. I love it. I love it. So guys, that's what an icon that's iconic. Right. The image that comes to mind when you think of any city, you can use this with any conversation. Obviously not just about New Year's Eve. Right. I would love to know what's iconic in your country, you guys. You can come back to the blog. Leave a comment. Let us know on social media when, when people come to your country when they think of where you live or your city. What is iconic there? What are the icons that they would think of? Yeah, I wonder because, you know, of course, for me, when I think of Paris, I think of the Eiffel Tower. That's the first thing that comes to mind. But I wonder if for a local in France, if that would be in their mind, the best icon of Paris or if there's something else like Walmart or something or the Arctitriens. Yeah, there's so many options that are maybe more because they might think of the Eiffel Tower is a little more touristy, but they may or Sanctrica is the big white church up on the hill. Yeah, it was like last days after east where all of the artists paint right there. Yeah, that might be more iconic for a Parisian, right. But all of them, all of them are iconic. Oh, it makes me want to go back to Paris. I know. Same. All right. All right. So we have another word for our listeners today. Aubrey, what is it? This episode is brought to you by Colloxyl. For soft, comfy stoos, use Colloxyl with Sennhe. The pink one that softens stoos and encourages bowel movement to give reliable, low-venight relief. It's Stefan with everything you need to know about stoos. Now I don't want to push it, pushing too hard. But I've even made a Stefan stool playlist to help you get a good feeling. So try Australia's number one constipation tablet brand Colloxyl. Softens stoos relieves constipation. Always read the label and follow the directions for use. Okay, must see. So this is a hyphenated adjective. This is something that visitors tourists absolutely have to see. It's mandatory because it's so important or famous like Times Square in New York. Yeah, I mean, what would be another? So I think Times Square is a must see. I wouldn't recommend hanging out there. I would not recommend getting a burger there because you're going to build $20. Don't eat there. It's not good food. And it's a chain restaurant chain restaurant. You're going to end up in Applebee's, which you could be in Wisconsin having Applebee. But what do you think would be for as a native, not a native of New York, but we live there? What would you say is a must see a New York city for? I think top of the rock is a must see. So you can go to the top of Rockefeller Center. And I highly recommend this over the Empire State Building because from top of the rock, first of all, you can see all of Central Park. You can see the Empire State Building. And they have all these cool art installations up there. And you can see the city from like a full 360, whereas on the Empire State Building, it's blocked behind you. And it's crowded. There's a million people up there. So you mostly see the backs of heads. But at the top of the rock, there's not going to be nearly as crowded. That's a must see for sure. Did you go to the top of the rock, Lindsay? Oh, my gosh. I think I did. That's a good pro tip. I love that. It's an insider tip that most tourism agencies are going to gear you towards the Empire State, but go to top of the rock guys. And so I'll just throw in another must see for me. The must see, I think, is downtown Washington Square Park. I really love the West Village, that area around NYU.

0:07:52I think it's so just natural and young and fun. There's artists there. It's just alive, especially at night. I had the most celebrity sightings in Washington Square Park randomly. I would see celebrities in line at Shake Shack. I, yeah, Shake Shack. And that's become a big franchise now, but originally it was just a small restaurant in a couple of parks in New York. That was the only place you could go. And now, yeah, it's kind of going everywhere, which good for them, right? To be able to make it and spread and be everywhere. I love that. You for sure, I agree. If you go downtown, you should go downtown and definitely go to Washington Square Park. I love it. So a must see. All right. So, okay, we have a last final vocabulary word. Now we're talking about, you know, on New Year's Eve, in New York, things could get crowded. So when we talk about crowds, what's a chunk that we use a lot as new speakers? This is a great phrasal verb to say to deal with that we use this. If something has a negative connotation of something that you have to handle, you have to take action or be patient with something. We might say, I don't want to deal with crowds in New York. So I'm not going to go to Times Square. Exactly. Exactly. That's why I would always avoid Times Square, avoid that subway station, maybe walk more towards Penn Station or even Harold Square just to get away from the tourism. Yep. You don't want to deal with it. Yeah, for sure. So guys, these are four really solid ways you could start a conversation, not just about New Year's Eve, but about any kind of big city or place where they're honestly like a lot of tourists, right, Aubrey? Yes, exactly. And don't hesitate to have that conversation with someone, even if neither of you are planning on going to New York, right away. You've seen movies about New York. It's a fun thing to talk about to say. Yes. Do you want to go to New York someday? If you went with something iconic, you would have to see what something you'd be worried about dealing with, right? Use that great vocab. Yeah, I love it. We talk a lot about New York City on this show. Michelle is based there. Aubrey and I have both lived there.
