I should have one ready because today we are talking about jokes. But I love I like the dad jokes, right? The cheesy funny silly dad jokes that are clean and just sort of fun and nerdy. They're so nerdy dad jokes. I love nerdy jokes. I love yeah, I love puns. I love word play, right? And I think this is one reason why I can like legitimately enjoy hanging out with my 10 year old son and his friends because we have a similar sense of humor.

0:02:18I still find stuff funny that 10 year old kids find funny. I just find just everything funny. Oh my gosh, that's so funny. What kinds of things the 10 year old kids find funny is it just things that are like silly? Is it like silly humor? Sillyness for sure. But word play because like they're proud when they understand these sorts of puns. And then any like you know, body humor because they're just like they're still little kids but they're like growing and so anything making fun of you know, bodies and what we do is always funny. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I mean I like puns. I think they're fun. I mean here's an example of a pun. After hours of waiting for the bowling alley to open, we finally got the ball rolling.

0:03:08Yeah, that's so great. Those are so fun. I think that's fun. That's so awesome. We do have a pun coming up for you towards the end of today's show as well guys. So stay tuned for another pun that'll get you laughing. But the reason why we're talking about comedies is we actually spoke to a teacher from Canada who had a podcast for a while. His name is Ron and the podcast was the English fun cast. And even though he does not publish these anymore, guys, you can still go to his website, Englishfuncast.com. There are 146 episodes on there. You can listen to you, you can read the jokes and you would hear them explained. So it's a great resource. Yeah.

0:03:59Why is this even important? Why are we sharing this with our students? Well, the whole idea here guys is that learning with humor is such a good way to learn because when we're enjoying something, we're laughing, we're actually learning more and learning faster. Don't you think, Jessica? Totally. Yes. And before we dive more into the benefits guys and we will convince you to learn about jokes and humor in English, let's go ahead and listen to Ron introduce himself. All right. So I'm originally an English teacher. I taught in China for a few years. And then I came back to Canada and I'm teaching here like our private high school. And in my spare time, I like to do comedy.

0:04:40I do a lot of stuff. I kind of comedy, I go to different bars in Toronto and I tell jokes. And what I did was I created the English Funcast podcast where it's a method where I can like tell jokes and at the same time teach English because when you like learn from jokes, if you laugh at a joke in English, it means you actually understood the joke. And these love puns you can learn like hominins and stuff like that. Okay. All right. That's awesome. So he actually does stand up comedy. Right? Wow. I would be terrified to do stand up comedy. What do you think you could do that? Well, I know Michelle has done a little bit of stand up comedy in New York.

0:05:17So we have to ask her about that. But no, I would never be able to do that. I think what's really good about stand up comedians is that they identify what's kind of mundane, they identify the funny in the mundane, the things that we all do that are kind of silly and funny. Yeah. And they pull that out in a way that most people haven't thought about before. So it's like everyone can relate to a stand up comedian most of the time. Totally. And I love going to comedy shows. Do you like to? Yeah. I love stand up comedy. Yeah, that's definitely the first. That is one way that stand up and build community and connection, right? Because you know that everyone watching this and hearing these jokes can identify and can't like have a similar experience, right?

0:06:01The other thing I really like about stand up is that they can take difficult things and perhaps painful things and shine light on them in a way that makes you feel better about something that's difficult. Yeah. You know, and that also I think creates community is like, you know what, we all struggle with a bunch of the same things. Yeah. And if we can make light of it, we can, you know, take that power away from the pain. And so that's another way that's kind of a heavy look at it. But that is something I really appreciate about stand up. Yeah, I mean, I've seen the proof that, you know, physiologically speaking, laughing does reduce stress. And we know it. We know that feeling a really good belly laugh, which is a bonus phrase for today, right? What is a belly laugh, Jessica?

0:06:48Oh my gosh. And I have something else to say about laughter. But a belly laugh, guys, that's just a phrase to describe a really deep big laugh. And I mean, like a real laugh, you know, not just like a polite like, yeah, it's not forced, right? Just it just boot like just booms out of you, right? Like you can't hold it in. But I want to share something real fast before Ron shares with us some of the benefits of humor. Okay. And why he wants to teach us about that. But just interestingly enough, so in James Health Unit in his class, they are talking about how to relieve stress and anxiety. And they talked about the science of laughter. And they said, even if you pretend to laugh, you make yourself laugh that will still have the same physiological benefits.

0:07:40Oh. A real laugh, which I thought was interesting. And they did something in class called laughing yoga. Oh, I heard that. I tried that before. Yeah. That is the coolest thing. It's so cool. Oh my gosh. Definitely guys. I love this as a way to deal with anxiety. But it was really funny because later on in that day, James was upset about something. And I was like, all right, let's do laughing yoga. And he was like, and then it totally worked. It's totally worked.

0:08:11All right. So let's go back to our friend, Ron. And hear about why he is doing this podcast and why students need to learn English through humor. I guess it's exciting, like it gets like the listeners or like the learners focused. And like when you start reading it, the theory to over and over again, once they understand it, they'll actually start laughing. And this way they know that like they understood what they just read. All right, Lindsay. So when we get back to Ron and a little bit more about why he made that show, I wanted to stop here and discuss this with you. So yeah, this method of learning, right? He wants people to get focused on the words, on the joke, right? And allow people to understand it. Yeah.

0:09:02Do you think it's important to understand jokes in another language? And why is that so hard? Well, I think it's, I do think it's super important. And I think a lot of it is hard because of culture, right? Yeah. For sure. Well, first of all, there's the concept of what's funny in another culture may not be the same, right? Yeah. And if there's a concept of a lot of what we use, what stand up comedians use or comedians, or just everyday funny people, they use cultural material, right? Material or ways of life, things we do every day. And that might be different across cultures too. So we have a couple of hurdles when it comes to understanding jokes in another language. But that's why I think it's the ultimate goal.

0:09:41To me, this is one of the highest signs of fluency when you can understand a joke and even when you can tell a joke and make others fall in a second language. So that's why our students, our listeners should feel motivated to keep going with humor because eventually you'll get there, guys. Exactly. And you know, we talk a lot about how the, one of the best ways to learn a language, guys, is to get into that target culture. Like it's not just about words that stand by themselves without context, right? And so culture is the context for language, right? And so yeah, it is super challenging, like Lindsay said, but it is such a worthwhile goal to try to understand this humor, guys, because you are not just learning words, you are learning culture, you are learning context. And this is how you're going to connect with native speakers in the future. Oh my God. So.

0:10:39This episode is brought to you by Colloxil. For soft, comfy stoos, you use Colloxil with center, the pink one that softens stoos and encourages bound movement to give reliable love and night relief. It's Stefan with everything you need to know about stoos. Now I don't want to push it, push it too hard, but I even made a Stefan Stool playlist to help you get a good feeling. So try Australia's number one constipation tablet brand Colloxil. Softened stoos relieves constipation. Always read the label and follow the directions for use. So good. Let's listen to a little bit more about Ron telling us why he started this show in the first place and why you students will love it. I just wanted to improve their English and have a good time while doing it. I think the most important thing when studying a language is to be able to motivate yourself. There's many different methods out there and people have to find the best method for themselves.

0:11:33If you like to laugh and learn, then maybe that's the method that they would enjoy. Okay. I love this so much. This laughing method. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I know. Because it's so different from anything that our youth listeners have ever seen. The old way is the classroom, the textbook, the memorization. This is the new way, guys. This is fun. Learning a language can actually be fun. That's why I'm so excited.

0:12:02We've got Ron here to hear from him and to understand this. Yes. Exactly. So, Ron did share with us a joke to tell you guys. So we are going to tell you this joke and I want you guys to really think about this. Why is this funny? All right, Lindsay, I'm going to tell the joke. Are you ready? I'm ready. I'm ready. Go for it. Last night, I went to a 24-hour grocery. When I got there, the guy was locking the front door. I was like, hey, the sign says you're open 24 hours and he goes, not in a row. I love it.

0:12:46I love it. I wonder if our listeners understood that joke. What do you think? I think some of you probably got it. But this is an idiomatic punchline. The punchline is that very last line of a joke that makes it funny. That's what is surprising. And it's what makes you laugh. And this one's an idiom so I could see why this would be difficult to get. So in a row, just means consecutive. Right? So, yes. Here's the thing. Usually, when you see something is open 24 hours, then that means like all the time. All the time.

0:13:21All day, every day. Yeah. But here, he's like, that's not what it means. It doesn't mean 24 consecutive hours. It could mean like 24 hours in a whole week and there only open like three hours a day or whatever. Right. Right. Or the month, who knows? Maybe they just have a very light workload. And so they just, they're open at selective hours, very selected hours. I love that. Exactly. And I'm glad you just going to you highlighted that term punchline because a lot of times people will say, and here's the punchline, right?

0:13:52They deliver it in that way. And that's kind of a fun weight. So, think to add to your language, guys. It's okay. I love it. And another sort of idiomatic throwaway line that we use a lot when we're telling jokes to our friends. Like, if you feel like your joke is taking a while or maybe you're just explaining too much, which I totally do sometimes, sometimes you could just stop and be like, wait for it. We say this sometimes when we're like, no, come on, the funny parts come and wait for it. So instead of saying, and the punchline is, you're saying, you're like, I'm going to say this, you can say, wait for it. And then pause and then give the punchline and that makes it even funnier. Oh, this is so good.

0:14:36And the intonation is so important to highlight for listeners to wait for it. You know, there we know something else is coming, guys. This is so good. I mean, I really want to encourage our listeners to go over and check out Rob's podcast, right? Just it definitely. Yeah. And remember, guys, like, I love that this is, I love that this is a fine item. It's a great resource because sometimes diving into a new podcast when you see there are 3000 episodes is kind of like, oh my God, where do I start? But the great thing here, guys, is that if you go to English funcast.com, you will see 146 episodes in all. That's all of them, guys. You could start from the beginning and each one, it's really cool. You listen to the podcast and right underneath it, you can read the joke.

0:15:26So read the joke first. That's what I think. And then listen to the podcast where he explains it and then go ahead and read it again out loud and practice telling the joke. I love it. So I want to say a big thank you to Ron for coming on. You know, for letting us know about his podcast, this has been really fun. Always good to know about new resources to learning. Yeah. Oh my gosh, for sure. And we have many more fun guests coming up in the near future guys. So stay tuned. All right. Also Jessica, thanks for hanging out today. My pleasure.

0:15:57I'm going to talk to you in the bike. Bye, Lizzie. Thanks for listening to all ears English. And if you believe in connection, not perfection, follow our show wherever you listen to podcasts to make sure you don't miss anything. See you next time.
