Michelle, how are you today? I'm good, I'm good, how are you Lindsay? Awesome, so excited to be here, I'm a show today we are here for our listeners to talk about, you know, how can we start conversations with native English speakers? Hmm, right? Yeah, that is a million dollar question, right? I mean, we want to start to think about how, you know, I think we've spent a lot of time thinking about how to seek people out, how to look for people, and how to find people, but how can you bring native English speakers to you?

0:02:04
That is a different way of thinking about this. That's so true Michelle, I love it, so it's like the pull factor. What is it that you can do about your self-presentation that actually makes people come up to you and want to talk to you, and I love this idea because it's not just for learning English, it's for anything. Right, it doesn't mean we have to be crazy flashing, we do have some ideas though, to be crazy, but it could be as subtle as what color you're wearing on your shirt. Right, right, uh huh. Now, all right, let's start with the crazy though, Michelle, so the off the wall factor, what does that mean off the wall for our listeners? Off the wall, it's like unique, totally different. Yes, totally different, sometimes shocking. The first thing I think about Michelle when I think about this and I've mentioned this on the podcast before, is that guy, I don't know if he still lives in New York, but when I lived in New York in the 2000s, he would walk around with a cat on his head, run Union Square downtown.

0:02:57
Oh my God. But that's just New York, there's a lot of crazy people in New York, a lot of crazy things are being done, but guaranteed he had people stopping him, he wanted that, it was clear that he wanted that. Do you have any other examples of things you've seen, Michelle, where people just are drawing attention based on doing something crazy? Oh man, I know that there are things, I don't know, I feel like, I don't know, sometimes people just wear things that are, like it could be like a statement necklace or like big pieces of jewelry or something like that, they kind of just like make people like look at them, yeah, find them interesting. I can't think of something specifically, but I don't know, I think that there was a girl in high school and she always just had this very interesting fashion and she was very engaging and interesting and like I still remember her to this day. So sometimes it, even if you're not like a fashion person, that's okay, but sometimes I don't know, play with things a little bit, you might, because I think, I think Native English speaker, I think we're known for giving compliments, we like to say, oh, I like this, I like that.

0:04:06
So like, yeah, where's something that I'll kind of draw that out of people? As we know we're humans, we want to connect, right? That's what the whole Aller's English is based on is connection, not perfection. We want to connect. So if I see someone, you know, another example could be your hair color. Maybe you decide to dye your hair in interesting color or your nails. Maybe you paint your nails like a blue or some other color that just stands out in someone, especially probably a woman is going to come up and comment on that. Or I think of tattoos when I think of this. There's a whole culture of tattoos in the US and they are definitely accepted. I would be discerning about where they are, of course, if you're in the business world. But when it comes to tattoos, people will reach out to you and say, I love your tattoo. What is this? That's a conversation starter, right, Michelle? Yeah, so this is just about the idea of thinking, is there anything physically I could do to get people to maybe give me a compliment, maybe start a conversation, maybe wear a shirt with like, you know, a city on it or something.

0:05:09
You know, like for me, I want to University of Maryland. Whenever I see somebody wearing a University of Maryland t-shirt, I'm like, oh, let's go. Go Terps. Well, that's a good point. And that leads to another key, right? Not just starting the conversation, but feeling that sense of tribe, right? That's her tribe. That person went to your school. The connection you towards team. Yeah, or even just yesterday, on Friday, I was on a Skype meeting with another entrepreneur that we get together and we share ideas. And we realized halfway through the meeting that we were wearing the same t-shirt. The exact same t-shirt. Yeah. And it was actually a podcasting t-shirt.

0:05:47
We had both been to a podcasting conference and it was a t-shirt for a brand, for a company. And we were like, oh my gosh. And then we felt connected. So it's a way to connect. Yeah.

0:06:29
That is great. Yeah. Of course, these are just different things to think about. I mean, different ways that you can draw those people to you that might get them to say, oh, like, like, let's say, like, okay, for example, you know, Lindsay, I mean, I'm new to two. I love Tokyo. Yeah, as we do. So if somebody was wearing like a shirt from Tokyo or somebody or any other place that I've traveled, don't have to be Japan, but any place that I've traveled to. Yeah. I would probably be like, oh, I've been there. Like, I loved it. You know, like, I would get excited. For sure.

0:07:02
Yeah, I think that that can be kind of a fun thing. Like, maybe of your favorite place, it doesn't have to be the place that you're from. You could wear a shirt, you know, that's just another place that you really like. Right. Which shows you traveled there or maybe, maybe, like, another thing could be like a shirt from a concert you went to. Um, music case, connect with music, so so many different things. Music takes absolutely. And then I'm thinking if you're gutsy enough, right? What does gutsy mean? Gutsy like, like, brave outgoing, brave, um, you know, a t-shirt with a political slogan, especially around the time of the election. I had a t-shirt that like very much signaled my political orientation. Yeah. And then I did get like nods from certain people, right?

0:07:47
People that recognize that, like, we had a connection. So, and then the last thing I want to mention is just colors, right? The color of your, what you're wearing, like, your t-shirt. That can also do a lot. Like, the other day at a conference, I was wearing a bright, gold yellow, which obviously I love that color. It's the color of all yours English. And I just love that shirt. And I got quite a few comments and compliments on the shirt. You just stand out. So in a group, people looked at me, like, I stood out in the group because of that bright color. Yeah. Yeah. That's good.

0:08:17
That's a good point, Lindsey. Yeah. Oh my gosh, so much. There's so much. There's so much that you can do. Just have fun with it, guys. Bring about a connection. Lindsey, this was fun, guys.
