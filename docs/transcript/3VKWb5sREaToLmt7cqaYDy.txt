Guys, if you have just started listening to Allers English, Michelle is on the show most of the time, but once in a while we get lucky and we get to have Aubrey on the show. So exciting. Yes, it's so fun to be over here. I love the Allers English. Audience, I get a chat with them often on Clubhouse, which is fun, and so you have time to be over here. Yeah, we are on all the socials, guys. We are on WeChat, we are on Clubhouse, we are on TikTok, Aubrey, we are all over the socials. Everywhere. And we do like to talk about business English for you guys because we know sending an email is a big deal, right? Because we do get judged on how we send that email by whoever is receiving it, right? Exactly. We don't want you guys to be stressed about this. If you have to send an email in English, we don't want you to be worried that you are not ending it correctly. How do I end it? So this today will clear that up for you.

0:02:24
Let's clear it up. So let's go into, we are going to give you guys a bunch of vocab today. Today is all about the vocabulary, and we are going to break this down by business emails, academic emails, and family friends casual emails. Okay. So we are talking about it all today, but take get out your notes, get out your pen and paper, and get ready to write this down. So this is just today talking about ending the email, right? Aubrey, we are not talking about the middle of the email or the beginning. Yep. Exactly, right? When you sign off, you want to say something that's pretty natural, and you want to make sure that it's appropriate for the email. So we'll first talk about business emails. When you sign off a business email, you don't want to say love. Don't do that. Don't do that. You've got to be professional. And also, let's talk about the nose first, the big no nose, the things to avoid, right? Aubrey, I've actually seen someone write ones just buy, like writing buy at the end of the email. Don't do that. Like BYE, like goodbye. Don't do that. Wait too casual. Wait too casual. And we just don't write that. We don't write buy. Yeah, that's a good point. We only say that. So it's not only is it too casual, like we would never write that. Exactly. So what should we do in a business email? Then what are a few that we should write? We should. You can sign off with best regards or just best by itself or regards by itself. All of these are really great professional ways to end a business email. Yeah, and it's interesting. I think I was watching a sitcom on Netflix the other night. And I think it was I think it might have been sex in the city actually where Carrie was dating someone. And the guy like left her house in the morning and he wrote a note and he said, I'm going to do this best and the guy's name. And she was very offended by that because it felt too distant. That's the thing. Yeah, because it's not really how you would. Yeah, definitely not with a close friend or family, right? It does feel more professional, more distant. Too professional. Too distant. Yeah. If you're dating someone. So this works really just for business, I think. Even for friends, I feel like it's a little distant. If you're writing a card like a birthday card or something, does it feel that way to you or no?

0:04:35
Definitely. It's very much sort of keeping someone at arm's length, right? Keeping the relationship very professional. So if you're wanting to let someone know how much you care about them, you would not want to sign something with just best. Exactly. Exactly. So we'll get to those and how to sign off at the end. So did we do the last two Aubrey or two more good ones? Warm regards. I really love this. I feel like it's definitely professional for a business email, but giving that little bit of a personal touch. Nice. I like that too. And then respectfully. I like this one, especially if you are emailing about something intense or something heavy or something like that. And it's formal, but it's a little friendly, I think. And guys, notice the lack of a sincerely here because I know you've seen in textbooks to end letters and emails with sincerely, but it's sort of outdated. I rarely rarely see anyone end an email with sincerely. We do not recommend it. That's a good point. And over on the Isles Energy Podcast, which is where Aubrey hangs out most of the time. Right. You guys talk about the Isles exam, the general task one letter for the writing test, right? Aubrey? And so, yes. Luckily for writing task one, you are provided with how you should begin the letter and sign off. Or, you know, there we do say just sincerely, just sincerely every time. Okay. Because for this letter, that's something you don't want to be thinking about. You don't want to be wasting time for no matter who it's to because the examiner isn't looking at that word. Okay. You score you, right? So you want to have it be the same one every time just to make sure you spell it correctly. Just leave that as is and then worry about the body of your letter to make sure that you're scoring highly. Got it. Wow. We're so lucky that we have that examiner inside over there with you in Jessica. That's amazing. That's amazing. That's a huge difference because if you go in on test day with not knowing for sure that you have strategies, you have advice from an IELTS expert, you won't be as competent. You're like, you know, am I ready? Do I have all the right strategies? You want that confidence on test day?

0:06:38
Yep. There's no room in your mind to be second guessing your understanding of the test when you walk into that. So I love it. All right. So this is great. So let's come back to this. So business emails guys as we've just said, you know, one more time best regards, best regards, warm regards or respectfully. So now let's go into academic emails. This is interesting because any of the above would work for academic emails. If you're emailing a professor or a research assistant, right? Any of those work great. And then you can also end with thank you or thanks so much. Yeah. I end a lot of emails this way with just thanks so much. I just think you can't say thank you enough. Sometimes I say thank you twice in one email. I just feel like you can't go wrong. No, and it's just friendly, but it's it's not too casual. It's not too formal. It's not too close. It's not too distance. It's just agree. Especially if you're if you're asking something of someone in an email, however, you know, casual of a request it is or something they know they had to do anyway. It's still just nice to have that sign off. Be thanks. 100%. So guys, you can't go wrong with that one. All good with that one. Now let's get into the more family friendly casual maybe neighbors that kind of thing. Yes. So take care. This is funny. My husband and I have this funny joke where if if we're leaving somewhere, you know, we've just paid for something or we've eaten and someone says take care. We always say they just threatened me because you could think about with to the wrong intonation. If you're like take care. Oh my gosh. Very silly. They're telling them to watch their back like telling them to watch us. And of course usually would people say that they of course they don't mean that but it's just funny to pretend they are. That's hilarious. I said that all the time. We can never meet up in person. I'm right. She's threatening me. That's so funny. So okay, then let me come back to you. So what do you tend to say, Aubrey? When you let's say for your volleyball team, your neighbors, your friend, you're playing volleyball. You shared with us on a previous episode that you're playing a lot of volleyball. What do you say when you say goodbye at the end of it in an email? Let's say you email them and you sign off. What would you say to them? Yeah, I think I still often will just say thanks. If I've emailed them about plans for something we'll do. We're doing right away and then to be like thanks, come on Aubrey.

0:08:59
It's tricky because these are it's not close personal friends. I still wouldn't sign it like love or exo or hugs. Those are all great ways to sign off for maybe my sister or my mom. My daughter, right? Very close relationships. But for more like acquaintances, friends that I play volleyball with, that's a kind of a specific relationship that's almost more like business. It's a little more hands-off. Got it. Good to know. It's business. You got to schedule your next game and show up and all the who's bringing the snacks, who's bringing the drinks after, all that good stuff. It's interesting because lots of people play volleyball with friends and close family members. That would change it all depends on the relationship you have with the person you're writing. That's so good. Another one that I like is all the best. I see this one is a little more distant. You're not going to say this to your parents or your siblings. It's too distant. But I think maybe for a family friend, for example, I was on the phone on Sunday with a friend of my dad. This guy that my dad went to optometry school with. I was asking him for some advice on real estate in Denver. I emailed him and I signed off all the best because we're friendly, but we're not formal. I love that because a lot of these, the way to sign off an email are quite a bit more casual and informal. This is when that's appropriate for a friend or someone that it's a little more casual, but also a little more formal, a little more respectful. I love it. Is there anything else that we should mention to our listeners that they could use in that email? You can sign it off with, you know, talk soon or speak soon, see you later or just later. All of these are saying, like, I'm going to talk to you soon. And then later is very casual. I almost feel like I use that more in spoken English, actually. I personally don't really use it. I think of like a 14 year old stater dude later. Yeah, that's true. I probably wouldn't sign an email later. I see that my daughter will text me that sometimes instead of like, see you later today. So to say later. That's very teenagery. So guys, if you're younger, then that's fine. And you know, I like that I think there's a bit of a culture. Well, cheers is good, right? So that's friendly. Maybe you're inviting close friends to a party. You're telling them about a Christmas party you're having or a holiday party, right? Cheers. Yeah, that's really friendly and fun to sign off with. Cheers. I also see, I feel like Jessica does that sometimes. I'm still signing it off cheers and it's fun. Yeah, and I also think that this is kind of international. I think I hear Australian English speakers doing this a lot or maybe it's British English or both.

0:11:38
Right. So I see this more outside of the US for native speakers than inside the US, right? And then there's Chau, which is always fun. If you travel the law, you've learned Spanish or Italian, you just enjoy throwing that into your language. Maybe you're at a meetup, you know, but here we're just talking about emails. I keep getting away from email. For some reason in my head, but yeah, if you're emailing a friend, international friend and you've shared travel experience, Chau is great too. Yes, and it's interesting. I was chatting with a friend from Brazil and she was saying that Chau is hello in Portuguese. Like Chau Chau is hello. But all for in the States, you would and it would be goodbye. And I think in the same in Spanish, right? That Chau is goodbye. So it's funny because Portuguese in Spanish are so similar that it would be interesting for this word that you use all the time to have a different meaning. Yeah, that's really and I think it isn't in Italian. It's a hello in goodbye. I feel like I want to say yes. I'm sure we have Italian listeners that can let us know guys. Let us let us know. And just real quick two things we should avoid. Don't use abbreviations like don't do see you like the letter C, the letter U. That's very juvenile, I think. I think with the text, you know, with how much we're texting these days, you might be tempted to put. It might be tempted abbreviations, LOL maybe even an emoji in an email. These are very inappropriate of course for business emails, but in any email, you know, I don't love emojis in an email at all. Yeah, yeah. And they usually come across weird too. It depends on the browser you're using it just doesn't keep that with text. Exactly. You want to make sure it renders correctly everywhere it turns up. Awesome. This has been really good guys. There's a lot of different ways to end an email, but make sure you're doing it with the right tone based on who you're who you're writing to. Yes, exactly. Alright, fun chatting.
