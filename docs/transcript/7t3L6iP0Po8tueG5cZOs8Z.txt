This is an All-Ears English Podcast episode 48. Are you the problem? How to learn English if you are shy. Welcome to the All-Ears English Podcast where you'll finally get real native English conversation and fluency for business and life. We believe in connection, not perfection, when it comes to learning English. Now here are your hosts, Lindsay McMan, the English adventurer and Michelle Kaplan, the New York Radio Girl, coming to you from Boston and New York City, USA. Are you shy when it comes to learning English? Today, get Lindsay's and Michelle's advice on how to overcome this problem and to start taking action to move through and beyond your shyness. Hey Michelle, how's everything today? Where are you up to? Hey Lindsay, I'm not up to too much, just hanging out. How are you?

0:01:25
How's your day going? Good, it's going well. Is there anything new in New York City? Are listeners of that you are based in New York and the most exciting city in the world? Yeah, no, everything's good and joying and going out to eat a little bit and go in the weather. Yeah, everything's good over here. Awesome. Well, I have a question for you, Michelle. About New York, actually. Do you think that people, if they're shy, do you think that they are able to succeed in New York? What do you think? I mean, a shy person in the big bad city of New York, where you have to be so forward, you have to be so aggressive in a way to get anything, including an apartment.

0:02:07
How should a shy person act in New York and can they succeed? Or do they need to change? That's a really good question. I think the beauty of New York is that anyone can succeed. I think that you can find a way. I think a shy person can definitely succeed in New York, but I do think you have to push yourself a little bit. Because New York is certainly more of a city where you have to be aggressive if you want to. There are so many people, right? So you have to stand out. You have to go to, I mean, if you're, let's say you're looking for a job, going to network events, networking events, things like that. However, then there are certain fields. It kind of depends, you know, what's your goal, right?

0:02:59
Or what are you looking to do? Maybe you're looking for a job in a certain field where maybe it's not as competitive. Maybe you don't need to be as aggressive or outgoing in that field. I mean, certainly if you're like an entertainment industry, it's different. But if you're in another industry, it might be different as well. So I think you can succeed. But I think overall, just because of the sheer volume of people, I think it's important to push yourself a little bit out of your comfort zone. What do you wish yourself? You live in New York. I lived in New York and I had to be very forward when it came to, like I said, finding an apartment in New York, we had to be quite aggressive. And finding a job, I had to really be willing to advocate for myself, right? But that's really true in many places. But especially in New York, because I think regardless of the industry, the competition could be intense, right?

0:03:46
Even working in a language school for me in Harold Square. I had to really say, hey, this is why I'm the right person for the job. And I had to show no sense of shyness or no sense of self-doubt. But at the same time, Michelle, we know that a lot of our listeners might struggle with feeling shy, but that doesn't mean you can't see improvement in your English, right, Michelle? Right, right, right, exactly. You just have to put yourself forward and kind of focus on your goals. And if you're a little shy, you need to think of ways to just, again, focus on that connection. It doesn't have to focus, like, have a focus on being like the star of the party, right? That's not what we're saying. Yeah, exactly. I mean, there are a couple things you can do. If you're shy, you can take an intermediate practice step, which means practice speaking on your own. For this show, you could, we could be the people that you're practicing with in a way, guys, where you could get our transcripts, you could read them out loud and learn with us by yourself before you go to that live event or that class.

0:04:50
What do you think about that idea? I think that's a great idea. Yeah, I think, you know, just really practicing, getting yourself comfortable. I think, you know, the more preparation, the better. Another thing you can do is record yourself. Oh, good one. Listen to your own speaking. So, I mean, I always like to tell my students that, you know, try recording yourself. It feels a little silly. It feels a little funny. Yeah. Yeah. And just realize, like, when you, I mean, Lindsay, do you feel, do you like listening to yourself? Oh, my gosh. I don't really, but actually, to be honest, I've gotten to the point where I don't mind it.

0:05:26
I don't mind it. I think that's because of our job. That's because we recorded a ton of audio together. That's how we're used to it. But that's the point, right? I mean, 10,000 hours of practice, right? That's the same as the thing that you need to just, did you get over anything? To move beyond a sense of, you know, being paralyzed, a paralysis or a shyness, we have to just do the action that we're afraid to do, right? And that's why I so if I listen back to, you know, the episodes from a long time ago, from all, or, well, we just started the show. So, really episodes, obviously, you know, when we just started it, when we first started of, you know, 40 episodes ago, we, it felt weird listening, but now, you know, I feel hang on it. Yeah, we're up here in the 40s, we're feeling better.

0:06:11
Right, right, right, right, exactly, exactly. Yeah. So, it changes. So, recording yourself and getting used to it and getting comfortable with that, I think is a, is a huge tool. Yeah, completely. And then the other piece, the other piece of advice today is be, be sure to choose the right context for going and practicing. Go to it. If you're going to go to an event, you know, even if you live in Taiwan, you live in Tokyo, you live in Thailand, the teas today for some reason. Yeah. You know, there are events of native speakers, of ex-pads, or even just English learners, where a teacher will be hosting the event, you can go make sure it's a friendly, a smaller event if you don't want to jump into a big one.

0:06:50
So, choose the right event, the right context that's not too noisy, okay? Right. Yeah, I think that'll definitely make people feel more comfortable, just kind of, you know, the expression getting your feet wet, you know? Exactly, exactly. I mean, I think we can end it on this idea, just make sure that you are not the one holding yourself back, guys, right? Be sure that that's not happening, because it could be, right Michelle? Yeah, it definitely could be. Sometimes we get too much in our heads, and too much in our nerves, and I think sometimes we just have to focus on doing things. Doing. Yeah. I've never been thinking about it so much, and I'm definitely guilty. I can think too much about things, and you kind of get into that paralysis, you freeze up, and, you know, just try and push yourself, say like, okay, I'm just going to do it.

0:07:40
Exactly, you're just going to do it, and that's why we're here to encourage you guys to show you that you should be focusing on connection, right? Not perfection, we're getting out of the perfection idea, and into focusing on connecting with human beings with our English. I love it so much.
