0:01:38Oh my gosh, I'm doing great. I'm excited to be here because we are talking about Inspiration. We want to inspire our listeners, but first guys, if you have not hit follow on the all-ears English podcast, make sure you do that. Michelle, why should they make sure to do that? Guys, well, if you do that, if you follow us and you're never going to miss any of our episodes and we are here four days a week, talking about connection, not perfection, so make sure you follow us so you never miss any of those. Absolutely. So Michelle, would you say, well let me ask you a question, are you ready? Yes. Okay, here we go. So what is the last thing that you went into just fully, just hard and soul you went into at 100%? I actually know I'm going to say, I would say marriage. That's a good one. Okay, interesting. I like it. Tell us more. Yeah, I mean, when you're making that kind of a commitment, it is you have to go into it wholeheartedly. You have to be true, you have to be yourself, and you can't hold back, right? So yeah, hold heartedly. It's to put your whole self into something and without holding back. So you can't go into marriage without putting your whole self into it in my opinion. It's very important. So yeah, I would say I went wholeheartedly into marriage. Wow, good thing. That's good. I love that. I love that. And just as a bonus, to make sure our listeners understand what this word means wholeheartedly, what does it mean exactly?

0:03:11Yeah, well, I think I said, you put your whole self into something without holding back. 100% right? And we don't do this with everything in the world, right? And we can admit that. Not everyone is 100% on everything all the time. If we were, we'd be exhausted by halfway through the day. That's right. That's right. Exactly. So guys, here is a quote about being wholeheartedly. So you have to go wholeheartedly into anything in order to achieve anything worth having. Ooh, I love that. I love it too. And it's so true, isn't it? If you think back to the things that you went half, I mean the opposite of that would be halfheartedly, right? Halfheartedly. If you think about what happened in the end to those projects, they just never panned out. Right? They never panned out. They never turned out into anything good. Right, right, right. Exactly. So, I mean, like for example, Lindsay, I think we go wholeheartedly into work on this podcast, you know, because we want to make it really good for our listeners. We want to do a good job. We want to be helpful. So we go all wholeheartedly into that. Yeah, I mean, we imagine you guys, wow, we're behind this microphone. We imagine that you want to connect in English, and we have the tools to help you do it. So that's why we put our whole hearts into it. But when it comes to learning English, Michelle, I think there's some key questions. That our listeners should ask themselves, and we want you guys to write down these questions to ask yourself later when you have the time. Okay, about your English learning. Right? Michelle? Right. Yeah. So one is why are you trying to improve your English? Right? What's the reason?

0:04:47Yeah. And then number two is, are you doing it because other people want you to do it? You know, there's a lot of things in life where, you know, we're human. We want people to like us. We want it to get along with people. We want people to love us. Right? And so maybe we'll do something because someone else wants us to do it. Right? Exactly. Yeah. You don't want to do that. And then that leads us to the next question, which is, are you doing it because you feel like you should? Oh, the should. The should. Right, right, right. The should. Yeah. You want to do something because you want to do it, right? And then the last question. Sorry. A few questions. Michelle. We have a couple minutes here. Before we get into the end here of the episode, do you feel like you use the word should a lot in your life? Of course. I think it's just natural. I don't think it says anything like, oh, deep about oh, but I, you know, but yeah, there's a lot of things that we should do where we don't always have the time to do them. But yeah. Yeah, I think I think I use a lot. What about you? Yeah, I guess so. But I think we have to watch this, right? Because if we're justifying things that we do a lot because we feel like we should, that means that we're not necessarily doing it because it's the right thing. It's something that we're obligated to do. So I think, you know, the frequency of the use of should is a really good barometer for how you're living your life. That's what I would say. Yeah. No, that's a good point. That's definitely a good point. Yeah. So Michelle, what's the next thing that our listeners should ask themselves? It's, are you saying that you want to improve your English, but not putting time in the time to make that goal a reality, right? So actually doing it, taking action is very important. So guys, like what are you doing? Right? Are you saying it, but you're not really putting in the time? Oh, I got good question, right? I think I'd have to call out a lot of our, you know, when it comes to preparing for the IELTS exam, you know, guys, you know that we have the IELTS Energy podcast. You can go over there and get started with your IELTS prep. But we have students who think that they can just get a band seven with 10 minutes of study a day. That's not possible. Right, Michelle? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So I mean, guys, think to yourself, like, what are you actually doing every day to improve your English? That is a good question to reflect on. That's the key question and go home heartedly into learning English or passing the IELTS or whatever it is you want to get out of your English study. Right? That go down, put it on your wall and go for it, guys. All right. Okay, Michelle, we are out here for today. Good to hang out with you. You too, Lindsay. Have a good one. All right. Take care, bye.
