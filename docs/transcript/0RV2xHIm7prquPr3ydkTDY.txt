The only thing I do to celebrate Valentine's Day is James and I usually go and pick out a bunch of chocolate to eat because I love chocolate, and well, I do help him celebrate Valentine's Day because he always has to bring Valentine's to his class for all the students. But he personally, no. What about you? Do you celebrate Valentine's Day? Lately, I've been doing a Valentine's Day. Each Valentine's, I have a couple of friends that will throw some kind of... Like Parks and Rack. Yes, like from Parks and Rack, you guys, if you've seen that, you know what we're talking about. A bunch of girls get together, maybe go out to eat, have a good time.

0:02:18
Just the gals. Because sometimes Valentine's Day can be, it's like too much hype. There's too much build up and expectations. And if that happens, then it's often a let down. You know, you don't have time to go to dinner because you've got kids, and I don't really love getting gifts, so it almost is too much pressure. Like, do I need to get someone else a gift? So, yeah, it's kind of rough. So, you and Cole don't celebrate it. I feel like that description is true for a lot of holidays. New Year's Eve too. Right? There's such huge pressure and expectation, and it's always kind of like, no, it was okay, or it was actually like an annoying night, because it was so crowded or whatever.

0:03:00
But anyway, today, guys, we are going to introduce you to FluencyMC. His name is actually Jason Levine, but he is known as FluencyMC. You guys should check out his YouTube channel. He teaches you English through rap songs, and he is a ESL professional in a number of ways, guys. I won't even go into his whole all of his accomplishments, but let me tell you, he is very accomplished in ESL. And this is something that you'll never get. You won't find anywhere else. Teaching you English through rap. So, let's hear what he thinks about Valentine's Day. All right. Part of this is very cool and real, and potentially romantic and special. Part of it to me is kind of over-commercialized. Not actually as much as the commercialism of it, sometimes, about me.

0:03:57
But I don't like that I'm cynical like that. I like to remember especially being young, and how much I like being young for Valentine's Day. When we were kids, if you guys ever remember anything about that. Yeah, like you said, like when we were kids, Valentine's Day was cute, right? Did you make Valentine's cards for all of your classmates? Yeah, for sure. I feel like we even made them homemade, or it was just a card with a message, and we personalized them. Now, my kids teachers say, please don't put individual names, so it's easier for kids just to drop them in. Like they don't want them having to search through them to find specific ones. So yeah, it's really commercialized, and they have to have candy, or they'll just throw it right away.

0:04:46
Yeah, it's kind of the worst now. It really has changed a lot, right? Like some for the better, because I remember having to do this, all growing up and exchanging Valentine's with your classmates. I don't remember if they told us to bring them for everybody. They probably, they maybe did, I'm not sure, but I know that like more popular kids would get more Valentine's than the less popular kids, and like you would always look through the Valentine's and hope the person you had a crush on would like give you a special card, and like it didn't happen usually, you know? Or you would like to leave the message and like read into it, if it was someone you had a crush on. You made the little conversation heart. Oh, what does it say? Totally.

0:05:33
And that's what it been eliminated, which I think is nice, because I don't know if we should romanticize too many relationships for kids yet. You know, so I think that's positive, but it has taken some of the fun out, I think. Yeah, I agree. I just feel like we end up as parents having to spend so much money, and the kids don't even care they just want candy. So that's the big negative for me. It's still exciting. It's just a different school day. It's something different to look forward to. But yeah, I feel like Halloween's the same sometimes where it becomes all about candy for kids. That's when it's a funer. Yeah, I don't know. I think that's kind of fun. I mean, as a kid, isn't that the best? Oh, yeah.

0:06:14
You have a whole night about candy? Why not? It's so fun. As a parent, I'm like grumble, grumble, but the kids are so excited. Oh, no, man. I'm as excited as they are. I'm the one that takes James' secret reading every year. I dress up as well. It's, I love it. It's so fun. Anyway, let's get back to Florence EMC. And he's going to tell us a little bit about today's topic. But as an English teacher, I really, I mean, holidays are great opportunities to talk about culture and to teach language. And Valentine's Day in particular is a really great one, because so many learners of all ages are curious about vocabulary and idioms for talking about the...

0:06:54
I mean, yes, of course, teaching students about anything related to holidays is so fun, awesome vocab, but also we get to talk about our culture, right? Yes, exactly. And love is always a great topic. It brings everyone together. Yeah. Everyone has something to say and wants to talk about. It's a, that's great too. Totally. And gosh, I mean, any vocabulary related to Valentine's Day, guys, do you listen to any music in English that you will hear songs about love, right? It could be heavy metal. It could be 70s Prague Brock. It could be hip-hop. Like any genre, guys, you're going to hear love songs.

0:07:39
I know how surprised I was when I first got into Led Zeppelin, because it sounds like such like a hardcore sort of band or whatever. They're totally that. Most of their songs are love songs. Right. Yeah, a lot of the hardest heavy metal rock, if you actually read the lyrics, it's a love song. Totally. So yeah, what we're saying, guys, is this vocabulary is so useful all the time. Speaking of music, this is the coolest thing today, guys, I'm so excited. Fluency MC wrote a special song about Valentine's Day, guys, and in it are some super cool phrases that you guys need to know. We will talk about these phrases after we hear his song. Do you want to hear his song, Aubrey? Yes, I can't wait. This is going to be amazing.

0:08:24
Okay. It's Valentine's Day. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's Valentine's Day. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

Okay. Okay. Hey. Hey. Hey. It's Valentine's Day. The day when you find the time and the way to say the things that you feel. To the love of your life. To your friend, you boyfriend, your husband, or your wife. Hey. Hey. Hey. It's Valentine's Day. The day when you find the time and the way to say how deeply you love and adore your sweet love.

The one in your heart, that special downer guy, the apple of your eye, your main squeeze, your soul mate, your partner or the person you just started to fade.

If you want to find this, we will have a link to the YouTube video guys that he made for this song.

And it has all the lyrics on the screen. You could like karaoke this. I mean that would be awesome. That was awesome. That is such a talent to be able to wrap, especially when people can do it on the fly without preparation. And it's so impressive. So impressive. I don't remember that movie eight mile about M&M and it showed all those rap battles. Like I'm just a white girl from a small town. Like none of this happened where I lived. And I thought that was so cool. Like I'm blown away by the genius involved in these rap battles. There's no way I could think that quick. I know exactly. It's so fun. So let's go through some of this vocabulary. There's really fun phrases on this. And the lyrics are there on that link. So you can check these out there. But the first one was Sweetie Pie. I love this. It's such a cute name just for someone we love. I got my, well no, I don't say this, but my mom calls my son Sweetie Pie. Like that's her favorite name for her favorite grandchild. So sweet. Sweetie Pie. That's so cute. I call him Sweet P. That's my name. That's so cute too. I feel like my parents also call my kids Sweetie Pie. And I will sometimes if I really find like snuggling and like, oh, you're such a Sweetie Pie. I love it. So I mean, this, that's what's great about this phrase is it's not just for, you know, like a boyfriend girlfriend type love. It's for anyone you love. You can call them your Sweetie Pie. And it's like you, I think it is often used for kids. Yeah. So, all right. The next one is more equivalent to boyfriend girlfriend to call someone your main squeeze.

0:12:55
And I think this is older guys. I don't think a lot of people use this anymore, but you heard it in the song. And I think you will hear it in other songs just because it is a fun phrase. Yeah, it is funny, but I think if someone called me this main squeeze, I'd be like, okay, so you have a lot of squeezes. I'm just your main squeeze. What? That's true. You could look at this very cynically and be like, oh, well, there have to be numerous for one to be primary. Right. How many so many so you have? That's a question. And ask that question. Don't be afraid. All right. The next one, soulmate. Now, this is something. Yeah, guys, you're going to hear this all the time in songs and movies all the time. The soulmate is the perfect person for you. So somebody that says soulmate believes there's like, you know, one person that the universe made for you. Do you do you believe in soulmates? I don't. I think you could be a perfect match for lots of different people. Maybe I'm wrong, but. Yeah, what's interesting. I feel like the younger generation is moving towards saying my person for this. Yeah, I mean that the one person for you, your soulmate, they'll say, you're my person. You know, and that's really a construction that has become a lot more mainstream in a number of ways when people are talking about their tribe. Right. That's also something we say now people that they're they feel comfortable with their community, the family they made and not the family they were born with. Kind of all of these phrases. We summarize by saying my people. You're my people. Those are my people, which I think is cute. But you're right. I think it's the singular is used romantically like, yeah, no, I found my person. He's my person, which I think is cute. I like it is cute.

0:14:46
And this is a very big compliment. I feel like it's very endearing for you to tell someone your soulmate, even if you don't believe there's just one person out there for you. If you feel like you've found the person for you, if you call them your soulmate, that's so sweet. Yeah. I think I don't know. I think there's a lot of pressure in that phrase. Like, maybe just like nobody is perfect. And I feel like, really? Oh God. That like, I don't know. That phrase has a lot of pressure for me. Okay. Let's move on. Okay. This next one is a cute idiom to describe someone as a good catch. Now, this is an idiom that's been around forever. But people still use it. So when you're talking about someone who has potential, right? Who is a good person to be in a relationship with because they are attractive or rich or like they have a good job or whatever. They're a good catch. I feel like this comes from more like the 50s and 60s when it's like women had to look for good catches because they had to get married and be supported because women didn't have access to things to support themselves. I feel like that's where it comes from. Yeah. That makes sense. And we often drop the good too. You'll hear someone just say like, he's a catch or wow. She's a catch. And you know that that's implied. They're good. Totally. Yes. That's a good point. I love it. All right. Two more quick ones. Guys, turn you off. That just means someone does something that stops you for bringing attracted to them. So for example, if I see someone chew food with their mouth open, that turns me off. That is a turn off. Don't like it. The next one, last one, guys, turn someone down. What does that mean, Aubrey? Yeah. It just means to say no. If someone asks you on a date and you turn them down, you're saying, no, I can't go. Yeah, exactly. And it doesn't have to be just romantic either. Like it could be, you know, a friend wants to go to the movies and you're like, I got to turn you down today. Sorry. Then follow it up by saying, rain check, which means sorry, I can't go to date. We'll go again another time. Rain check. Okay. I use that all the time. I feel like it softens below of saying no. I really do want to hang out with you sometime. Let's rain check and do it soon. Yeah. Oh my gosh. So many great phrases today, guys. So definitely check out our guest YouTube channel. It's just called fluency MC. So many fun lessons on there, guys. Definitely check it out.
