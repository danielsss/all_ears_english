I'm great, I was able to go play volleyball last night, and that always makes my day so I woke up feeling really happy today. So cool, you managed to get a lot into your schedule. I have to be kind of wise with my time, but I do, it was late, I played from like 8 to 10 pm, because I know before that I'm getting kids to bed. So, sometimes you have to sneak in the exercise where you can fit it in. That is awesome, and I'm glad we're talking about exercise a little bit today. This week, we're coming to the end of 2013 guys, and we're talking a lot about looking at the new year, what we want to do in 2014 is going to be a great year. What are the goals that we want to set? Have you ever heard of the concept Aubrey of reverse engineering success? Yes, and I think this is so wise when you're more looking back on what you've done, was it a good goal, how could I adjust it going forward? Exactly, and the way we learn about what works is based on what's worked in the past. I think that's how it works.

0:02:44So, maybe let's put this into a little bit of context. So, when we're going to reverse engineer our success, when it comes to setting goals, let's look back at last year, and let's use an example for you Aubrey of exercising. How does that sound? For sure. So, I can share, I made a goal last year. I wanted to exercise more, but I was going to be more aware of making it fun, because if I'm like, I'm going to the gym, I hate going to the gym, I don't end up doing it. So, I was recognizing in myself a need to make it enjoyable and more fun, or I wasn't going to do it. So, I love volleyball, and I just prioritized more, I joined a league, I got together with some more friends, and was more proactive about creating opportunities to play that and having it scheduled, so that, you know, I'm not going to let people down, because with volleyball, you need a certain amount of people to play. And that has really pushed me to do it more, to be more active, and I have, I'm exercise more this year than probably ever in the past, because I'm actually practically doing something I enjoy. That's fantastic. So, when we think about the first step here, right, we tell our listeners to do is we think back and we say, what were your goals, right, and for you guys, it would be English, for our listeners, something English-wise, or life, we talk about life on this show a lot too. But for you, Aubrey, you said, maybe I'm going to say, I'm guessing maybe you said, you want 90% of your exercise to come from volleyball, does that sound about right? Ooh, and I like that you're putting a number to it, because I don't always do that, and I think it's so wise, right, I might just say, I want to exercise more, but if I'm saying, instead, I want to exercise every day for at least an hour, and to put a percentage on how much of it should be volleyball in order to be fun for me. Yeah, definitely I could say, I want 90% of it to be volleyball, and I didn't do that, and I think that would have actually helped even more to make it more measurable. Yeah, I just a side question, is this sand volleyball? Like, no, not beach volleyball, we're in Arizona here, so. Right? I play a lot of sand volleyball, but yeah, we don't call it beach volleyball in Arizona, because there's no beach, but there's a lot of sand volleyball. Okay, but also indoor. I feel like an indoor, especially if it's hot out, but in December, it's really nice in Arizona, so we play a lot of sand volleyball. And which is the better workout, by the way? Is it more of a sand?

0:05:04Definitely sand, because with the unleveled ground, and you have to like put so much more energy into jumping, to get up and hit, and it's so much harder to get to the ball. So there's definitely, I'm definitely more sore, more I can feel a harder workout when I'm playing sand volleyball. I love that. Okay, so we've got, so we know what you set as a goal. You want to most of your exercise that come from volleyball. So tell us again, what did you actually do? Like what actions did you take towards those goals? Just for a quick kind of, yeah, yeah, enjoying the league. So that was big because it's not cheap, right? You have to spend a certain amount of money, and you're playing with, so we were playing fours. Often you would play twos for sand volleyball, but we were playing fours. So it was a team where you can't let them down. You have to find a sub if you can't play. So I was prioritizing it and planning around it to make sure and go, and it was a league that's in the evening. So it was a little easier for me to go, even though I have kids. Okay. Also, made friends and contacted some friends that I knew that played volleyball and planned times to play with them as well. So I knew that, you know, I was scheduling it, and it's because it's not, it's a hard sport to just say like, who wants to play volleyball out of the blue? You have to plan ahead. You have to schedule it. And it's been so fun. I've been able to make a lot of really close friendships while getting a good workout. That's awesome. I love that. So you told us what actions and guys you're going to do this with your English goal. You're going to tell us what actions you ended up taking towards those goals. And then the final question is, do you feel like you achieved your goal, Aubrey? Did you achieve your goal? Yeah.

0:06:39Yeah, definitely. I played weekly sometimes twice a week. Yeah. And I exercised more this past year than I think ever in the past because when my goals were more general, like I need to exercise. I'd go run a couple times, maybe join a gym, but never go. And so this was much more effective for me to think about when I'm thinking about my goal, how can I stay motivated? How can I stay engaged? I need to make sure it's enjoyable. So I'll stick to it. Yeah, I love this. And so now we can think back and we can reverse engineer what were the elements that were there for success. And then you can apply that new those insights to the next goal. I mean, it seems like one thing I'm hearing is that you had friends involved. Yes. And that is huge, right? If a special little for volleyball, it's a social sport. You cannot play volleyball on your own. And it's the same with learning a language. You guys are trying to learn English just by yourself and never involving anyone else. It is hard to stay engaged and motivating, motivated. At least at this podcast, we're here with you, right? Yeah. It's us three together, at least. But you should be finding people to speak with, right? Listening in other contacts and chatting, find people online or in the city where you live through like meetup groups so that you can make friends engage with other people learning English. Exactly. And I think another piece of your plan here was knowing yourself. And you knew that the gym was just not working for you. Right? You today is just not your thing. Dark, dingy, jim. Just not doesn't isn't compatible with who you are. Right? So you made another plan. So these are all elements of success. So we want you guys to look back, see what goals you're successful at. And then reverse engineer, why did those things work? Right? Yeah. Or not work, right? If you have a goal that you didn't work, you didn't do it. Why? Think about when you said it, did you make it measurable? I definitely could have done that better, right? Did you decide how long, how many days a week? What exactly, you know, what exactly are you going to do? Have that really clear in your mind? Otherwise, it's hard to make it work. Oh my gosh. So I didn't realize when you said volleyball, I was envisioning a team of like eight people. So I was thinking like there's not a ton of movement there, but you're talking to on two or four on four. That seems like an incredible workout. Yes. And surprisingly, if you if you play volleyball with six on a team indoor, at the level that, you know, I'm playing volleyball. It is your breathing heart. It's a really hard workout because you're playing position. So you're running all over. You're jumping and blocking. You're jumping and hitting. You're running and diving to get right. So it's not what you're imagining, maybe with like a family reunion recreation volleyball, where you just something over. Drinking your hand. This feels a little like a maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but it's what you see when you see indoor volleyball on the Olympics, where it's high energy and active. Yeah, it's closer to that than to family reunion volleyball. Not that I'm an Olympian, but it's more at that level. And fun. It's really fun when you get to that level. Well, I definitely don't want to be on the other side of the net when you come up and spike it down. Abram, I'm going to stay away from that for sure. That's the safest place to be. Lindsay is right on the net jumping and blocking. And the worst is that some little sometimes stand like four or five feet back. That's when you're going to get a ball right in the face. That would be made. That would be me.

0:09:49Has anyone like broken a nose or anything? Oh, yeah. I've seen people break fingers when they're blocking break a nose. If you take one to the face, my husband actually has a concussion as we speak from taking a volleyball to the head. We're playing sand volleyball. Oh, my God. Okay. All right. I know what I'm not going to play. Not good to know. It can be a little violent, a little unsafe. Oh, that's so funny. I love it. So guys, this is how it's done. We've just analyzed the goal that Aubrey sent set up for 2013. And whether you know how she became successful. So we want you to do this. Look back at your year and then think, okay, what's my goal for 2014? And how am I going to get there? Love it. Yes. Awesome. This was great. I'm excited to hear about you guys' goals. Let us know on social media what goals you're setting. Yeah. Totally. And hit follow on this show. You don't want to miss all those English. We've got four days a week. All those English.
