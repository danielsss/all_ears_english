Everything is good, everything is good a little bit rainy but that's okay, that's okay. There's a hurricane going on, there isn't there on the U.S. Yeah, kind of didn't know what to expect but a little flooding but not going to one, things are okay, it's just still kind of rainy. Wow, that is insane. Well guys, we're going to get into an interesting topic today but before we start I want to make sure you go ahead right now and hit follow on the All-Ears English Podcast. We publish four days a week for you guys and we want to make sure you don't miss a single episode right Michelle? That's right, exactly, exactly. We're happy to have you here. So today we are talking about a very interesting topic dealing with really, I'll say, transportation, getting around. Yeah, transportation in the U.S. and how it's changing, right? And also what this means for American culture and how American culture is changing.

0:02:29I mean, you know, for me in Boston, I've been noticing a lot more people are biking these days to get to work especially in Cambridge, Mass, you know, they're biking to Harvard, they're biking to MIT, they're biking to the tech and science companies in Kendall Square. Okay? Yeah, I'm seeing a lot of that because parking is expensive and no one wants to sit in traffic, right Michelle? Right, right, right. I think we all just kind of hate traffic. Yeah, I mean, I live in, you know, the city so I walk, you know, I took trains. Yeah, but I'm very rarely in a car. Right, so have you ever biked in New York? Have you ever done the commuter bike situation in New York? That's my question. No, I have a fear of riding a bike. Okay, so I like a ride a stationary bike. Okay, all right, a stationary bike. You stay in your house with a peloton, but not biking to say. So I've lived in Boston in New York and I'd say I've biked in Boston, although it's scary, but I would never bike in New York. Yeah, I would bike, I would have to be like and just like a sea of pillows and of course you can't bike in a sea of pillows. Like I so, but that would be my ideal biking situation, but other than that, no way in New York. I have actually my friends, they want to teach me, well, I have a friend who's a really good biker and he said that I could ride around his neighborhood a little bit. So we'll say, okay, his neighborhood, so meaning Manhattan, Brooklyn. No, he, he lives in a suburbs. Okay, okay, so that's better. I'm picturing you like wrapping yourself in pillows, Michelle. Yeah, or like, I think that bubble, yeah, bubble, bubble wrap. That's a layer is don't forget the helmet. Right. Oh, never. Yeah, but I mean, guys, this is a trend that's happening in the U.S. and certain cities are seeing it more than others. I think only the crazies will bike in New York, just because, you know, the cars are aggressive in New York. They're, you know, walkers everywhere, but Boston, Denver, you know, in Denver, what I'm seeing is more people are actually scooting. They are scooting, Michelle. Did you have a scooter when you were a kid? I didn't, but my son has a scooter now. Okay, scooters are the best.

0:04:37I didn't really have a scooter when I was a kid and now I feel like I get to have my scooter. You know, so there are these programs, right, Michelle? What are they? They're kind of like raw, they're, they're share programs. Right. Right. What's going on with these? Right. Yeah, well, basically, I think it's like works maybe through an app. Yeah. And you like get to borrow, you like sign in and then you get to borrow it and then drop it off in another location. I've never done it, but I know they're very popular. Yeah, it works for bikes and it works for, for scooters. I remember when I visited Chicago a few years ago, my friend and I just had an absolute blast, renting these bikes. They're a little heavy. They're hard to bike, but you can't go very fast on them. Yeah, they're heavy there, you know, but you just go all over the city. You don't have to worry because you don't have to worry about your own bike getting stolen. You just drop it off and then take it back out. It's great. Right. Right. Right. That's awesome. Yeah. So guys, I think that in general, a lot of, I mean, well, cities are totally different. I mean, I'm not going to say that there are no cars in the suburbs. I mean, I think it just depends on where you live, but in the cities, things are definitely changing as far as like, you know, creating new, innovative ways for people to get around. That's all right. Like, if you don't want to take the train, if you don't want to drive in a car, take a cab, whatever, that you can, you know, get around in other ways.

0:05:55This episode is brought to you by Collox Hill. For soft, comfy stoos, use Collox Hill with Senna, the pink one that softens stoos and encourages bowel movement to give reliable love and night relief. It's Stefan with everything you need to know about stoos. Now, I don't want to push it, push it too hard, but I even made a Stefan stool playlist to help you get good feeling. So try Australia's number one constipation tablet brand Collox Hill. Soft and stoos relieves constipation. Always read the label and follow the directions for use. Yeah, things are definitely changing. I think certain cities are more innovative than others. Certain cities are trying to plan for the future. I mean, Michelle, how do you see the typical American city in 25 years, let's say? I mean, how do you see the commute? What's the balance between people still driving their car, the old school way versus people scooting, biking, maybe something else? What are we talking like real, real city? Yeah, let's talk about Manhattan because I know that places like Manhattan and Boston, they've been closing down major streets, major avenues to give more space to other ways to commute. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. I have seen streets that are closed, or they might be more for pedestrians either or pedestrians too. Yeah, pedestrian plazas, things like that. So I do think that there is a shift in that way. And I think as more of these sharing programs become popular, I think it's just going to continue that way. I mean, maybe there'll be a little less congestion as far as traffic goes with cars and things like that.

0:07:28But I think I think there will just be more of all this. Yeah, I mean, I wonder if we'll have more scooters because I know when I go to Southeast Asia like Vietnam or even Italy, for example, there's just scooters everywhere. Everyone's riding those little bikes, which looks like so much fun, but crossing the street in places like that, especially Vietnam, oh, it's so scary Michelle. So scary. Right, right. I mean, it's interesting. Yeah, when I know when I went to Amsterdam, there was so, you know, everybody was riding a bike. And sometimes I think like, oh gosh, like if I had to move somewhere like that where I was like, everybody was riding a bike and I couldn't. Oh my gosh. But like in New York still, it's not I would still say them and, you know, there are a lot of bikers, but I wouldn't say it's like, oh, everyone's riding a bike in the same way as some other cities or scooters certainly. But I think that I think that could develop. It could develop. I mean, I think in New York, the train still doesn't always well-dominated. It's just the most convenient way. The New York City subway spreads to more places than, for example, the Boston MTA does. It's just a lot more convenient than most cities. Denver doesn't even have a subway. They have a light rail, but it really doesn't go anywhere. So in New York, it's all about the subway, but we're still such a car-centric culture. Right. Right, right, right. Exactly. And that's not going to change for, you know, other parts of the country, I don't think. So, you know, you got to, it's, it's, it's that mix. A little back and forth, a little give and take. I think the rest of the world is ahead of the United States on this. We can thank Henry Ford for that. You know, I mean, the way they set up the United States really was all about engineering, manufacturing a car industry, right? They built these huge freeways, inner states, so that people would buy cars.

0:09:13And we can go into this in another episode, but that's why we're still so attached to our cars, and so much of our lives is built around the car in American culture. Right, right, right. Oh my gosh, very interesting topic. It's so much to discuss. Yeah, really good stuff. So guys, in the next episode, we're actually going to talk about a little vocab that we're going to give you to talk about these things. All right, so a little bit of a follow-up episode.
