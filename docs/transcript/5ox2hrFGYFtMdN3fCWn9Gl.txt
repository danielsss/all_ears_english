Hey Michelle, how's everything going? Hey Lindsay, I'm good, I'm good, how are you? Awesome, I'm happy to be here in the last couple episodes of All-Ears English 18 and 19. We talked about transportation and how that's changing in American cities. And the vocab for us, so guys, go back, listen to those. But today, Michelle, what are we getting into? Today, oh my gosh, I'm excited for today's topic. It's something to do with the phone and practicing your English skills. It's really fun, it's a cool concept. It's a really cool concept and this is, you know, I know that for a lot of you guys, you use English at work and you're socialized, but the high pressure moment is when you have to answer the phone.

0:02:04So today we have a strategy of how to practice your English on the phone for free. It's going to take a little bit of a risk here. But you're initiating the call, so that's why we can change our mindset and we can get in really good practice. Michelle, how exactly does this work? Okay, well, so the idea here is that you make a call, you look at, you know, the things in your house. And you think of something, like, you know, everywhere has a phone number, you can call. If you have any feedback, call that number, even though it's got a buddy, even though it might be scary. And think of something that you want to say, either something good or maybe some helpful feedback you have that maybe it's a little bit more critical. And call and give that feedback. Exactly, Michelle. I mean, this is off the wall and crazy. It sounds crazy. It's not something your typical teacher is going to recommend, but all those English is not your typical podcast, right? So, you know, what are the common objections for people when they're introduced? Well, they think that they're going to bother the person.

0:03:08Well, I mean, my answer to that is this person is here waiting for your call. They're available. And the key to this is make sure you offer genuine feedback. So you're actually helping them improve their product. So you're not just wasting their time. You're saying, oh, this is what I would rather it be, right? Or this is how you could make it better. Right, Michelle, what do you think about that? Right, right, right, exactly, exactly. It doesn't have to, like, you don't want to just pick something silly. Like, really put some thought into how you could improve a product or something helpful for the company. Or maybe it's a question that you want to ask, you know, about updates that may be coming out in the future. You know, a question is fine as well. That's another way that you could go. Yeah, I love that.

0:03:50And I just want to give our listeners a little bit of vocabulary for asking this. You know, sometimes I see things in the news where certain products have been recalled because they have some kind of contaminant or they have some kind of chemical that they've found is harmful. So you could do something like that. Let's say you have Windex or something. Would I think of Windex, Michelle? I think of the Windex. What's that? What's that movie where he sprays Windex on every thing? Oh, my God, that's a great question. Yeah, yeah, they put Windex on everything. Yeah, watch that movie, guys. It just makes me think of that guy when something's wrong. He sprays Windex on it and it gets everything better. Right, right, right, right, don't that.

0:04:27Anyways, let's imagine you bought a thing of Windex. And you know, you want to know if a certain chemical is in that Windex. Right, so what is something, how would we ask that question to the customer service person in English, Michelle? Okay, if you want to know if something is in the Windex. Yeah, so you can say something like, oh, I'm looking for information is this ingredient in your product. Okay. Yeah, exactly. So that's one structure. Right, is titanium. Let's just throw any ingredient. I don't even know if titanium would be in Windex. Probably not. It is titanium in your product in this Windex. Or does your product contain titanium? Okay, those are the two that I've got that way too.

0:05:17Yeah, and this is going to stay. And then try to engage in a little bit of a conversation. How you would improve it. How you use it, these companies, they want to collect customer data on who you are and how you're using their product. Right. Yeah. Right, so yeah, it's completely fair to you know, ask them these questions, give these comments. And I think you know, look at it as a way to be helpful, right? Again, don't just think of just any old random thing to say, but put them thought into it, maybe practice before you call. And yeah, this could be just a really great way to practice your English for, and not spend it any money doing it. I know, it's so clever. We live in a world where everything's done just online, you know, through Amazon. I just ordered something in Amazon and I had to return it and there was just no interaction, but we're losing. We don't want you guys to lose the ability to speak on the phone because you don't have to very much, right? You need to be practicing these skills.

0:06:13Michelle, have you recently had to call some service or company to add something, ask something, complain about something? Oh, I'm not that I can recall right the second, but I'm sure there has been something. Right. So we still have to get on the phone to do. Oh, for sure. Yeah, exactly. And so what I love about this strategy, guys, is that you're manufacturing a real situation. You are not in your room in front of a textbook reciting or rehearsing or memorizing, even worse, memorizing a dialogue, which is what most textbooks and classrooms are going to tell you to do. Right. What we're doing now is we're asking you to take a little risk and you're going out there and you're dialing a number in the phone. That is real English. Right, right, right. Oh, my gosh. I love this idea. Lindsey, this is so much fun. So guys, remember to give this a try. You know, this is a way to practice real English on the phone. Yeah. And you know, don't be, don't be afraid. Just try it. What's the worst that could happen?

0:07:11I love it. So good. And that's our tip for today. That is how you can practice English on the phone for free. Try it this week, guys, and let us know back on the blog, allersenglish.com. How it went. Okay. All right. Cool, Michelle. I'll talk to you soon. All right. Bye, Lindsey. Bye, guys. Bye. Thanks for listening to all ears English.
