That was kind of through a wrench into things, but today they're all back at school, so I'm getting a lot done. Love that, I'm getting ready for the weekend.

0:01:49I'm going to go to do some hiking. We're going to go have a weekend away with another couple other people, rent a house, and enjoy a weekend in the countryside, the mountain countryside. Oh, that's so fun. Is it like a VRBO type situation? Yes, exactly. Really nice. Have you had good experience with those? Yeah, I usually do Airbnb, but I know VRBO is a good option. Yeah, I like it. It's fun. It's getting more expensive now than it used to be, but it's obviously a great alternative to a hotel, for sure. Yeah, I was listening to the, like how I built this with GuyRaz for one of those companies, and it was fascinating to see just like hear how it started. Yeah, and I'm the same. We use those a lot when we got in Mexico, and I've been kind of about looking into doing it in other countries. Oh, yeah. It's a great option. Oh, no, we've done it a ton in other countries. It's especially, I think it's getting more expensive in the States, but I think abroad, it's still pretty affordable. Yeah, we did it. No, when we did our live event, we did it in Japan in a few places, and German, I mean, it's great. Definitely check it out, for sure. So looking forward to the weekend off, but we're talking a little bit about enthusiasm, right? And I think what are your thoughts on just enthusiasm in general? Does it arise naturally? I went, does it arise for you? Oh, for sure. All of a sudden, I mean, I just got really enthusiastic about VRBO. What is the little listening? And, you know, I'm enthusiastic about everything. I can't think of very many times where I, where it doesn't just come naturally. Whatever I'm talking about, I just jump like zero to 60 full enthusiasm really fast. What about you? What about something that, okay, so let me just play devil's advocate here with the other side? What about something that just doesn't interest you? Is there anything that, you know, maybe you have to do, let's say, okay, paperwork, you have to submit paperwork to your city, to your county, because your address chain, something like that, right? That's a really good example. There's no enthusiasm there.

0:03:48Yeah, that's a good point. If it's anything I'm interested in, even if it's, you know, reading the news and finding, like, learning something new, it doesn't take much for me to find enthusiasm, but some of those drudgery things that are just like busy work or filling out paperwork, taking my daughter to get a sports physical. Oh my gosh. Yeah. I'm enthusiastic about that. Oh, no, no, no. I want to highlight a word you just shared for our listeners. Guys, write this one down. That was a great one. So drudgery. Right, drudgery. What does that mean? Red, right? It's something that's not fun for anyone. I think about like the story of Cinderella where she's scrubbing the floors and say, oh, that was a drudgery. Yeah, completely, completely. I also struggle a lot with anything involving government, city government, local fed government and paperwork. I just, oh my gosh, I go crazy. But when it comes to learning English, I mean, there should be enthusiasm there. We're going to talk a little bit about if it's not there, what can you do? But first, Aubrey, let's start with a quote from Emerson. Yes, Ralph Waldo Emerson said, enthusiasm is the mother of effort. And without it, nothing great was ever achieved. I agree with this 100%. Yeah. And by the way, a couple of years ago, I actually went to Emerson's house in Concord, Massage Chooses. There is nothing like walking into a house that's that old and like seeing the robes and things that he wore. It's amazing. It's amazing. I have been there and I didn't realize there was a house we went to Waldo Fond. We like went all over. Yeah, there is. No, no, you're right. You're right. You're right. Yeah. You went to Waldo Fond. That's amazing. Right. We didn't know there was a house we could tour. I'm so jealous. I wish I could have. Yeah. It's right in the center of Town and Concord, Massage Chooses. And it's where he lived with his family. So I think he was the mentor of Thoreau, right? I've Henry David Thoreau. As far as I understand. Yes.

0:05:37Yeah. So really cool. Wise man. Anyways, he was right. Wasn't he? Enthusiasm has to be there. I mean, I can tell you with all his English, we're going strong here. We're an episode 35, but there's going to be a lot more episodes. Yes. We know it somehow. Big plans. So every, you know, when we podcast, we actually love it. So, you know, we want you to ask yourself today, are you enthusiastic about learning English? And if your answer is me, you're kind of not so much, then ask yourself why. And what are some questions we could ask to find out why? Yeah. So are you using the wrong materials if you don't feel enthusiastic, right? If you don't feel excited about what you're studying, what are you studying, right? Are you reading just the news? Or are you reading a novel that is a page turner that you really enjoy? Yeah. I mean, are you just reading your textbook? Because that's so boring. You know, there's so much out there for you beyond your textbook. If you're still stuck in the old way of textbooks, classrooms, memorizing, get out of it. You know, all our English are show. We offer something completely different because we think about connection, not perfection, right? Aubrey, what does that mean? Exactly. You don't want to be so worried about everything you say being perfect instead, focus on making connections, both with what you're reading and listening to. And with other people who are speaking English native speakers or others learning English, those connections, what's going to keep you enthusiastic about learning a language?

0:07:08Exactly. So the first thing is the materials and what's the second thing, Aubrey? This episode is brought to you by Colloxyl. For soft comfy stools, use Colloxyl with center, the pink one that softens stools and encourages bowel movement to give reliable know-of-the-night relief. It's Stefan with everything you need to know about stools. Now I don't want to push it, push it too hard. But I even made a Stefan stool playlist to help you get a good feeling. So try Australia's number one constipation tabitrant Colloxyl. Softened stools relieves constipation. Always read the label and follow the directions for use. Do you maybe need different people in your life to inspire you? Do you have speaking partners? Do you have someone to chat in English? With? If not, you need to find one. Totally. I think this goes beyond just the direct application of practicing English. Do you have mentors in your life either, you know, maybe people in TED Talks or podcasters that you've listened to? Or it could be just personalities on TV or actual people that have done exciting things that you look up to. So you can see, they did that, they built that business, they did that thing. Now I can learn English because I see they did that. Right? That's a really good point. Listening to TED Talks, listening to podcasts, like how I built this is a good one. Get inspired about people who are entrepreneurs and have started companies and done amazing things. And all the while, you're listening to English and engaging and being inspired. Yeah, we really have to see. I mean, one person that has always inspired me is Simon Sinek.

0:08:43And I don't know if you know who that is, Aubrey. Simon Sinek is a business thought leader. His whole philosophy is start with why. So when we're building companies, we're starting with thinking about why do we exist as a company? What's our point in the world? And you know, we exist because of connection, not perfection, right? That's our why. But Simon said he did a great TED Talk that went viral. It was everyone aided up. They loved it. So he's a thought leader in the world. He inspires me. And of course, many other people do too. But who inspires you? You want to find out who that person is? Yes, I actually just taught a business personal coach class recently. And we were doing a practice for an interview. He had an interview coming up wanted to practice some questions that might come up. And he talked about listening to the TED Talk by Simon Sinek. And I would inspire him. And it was such a great idea to talk about that in this interview. This job interview is very impressive. I love that. And interviewers are going to love that too. Fantastic. It sounds like that student is on the right track to get his dream job. Totally for sure. I love it. I love it. So good. So Aubrey, watch our listeners.
