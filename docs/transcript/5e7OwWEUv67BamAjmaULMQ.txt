Are you feeling stuck with your English? We'll show you how to become fearless and fluent by focusing on connection, not perfection. With your American hosts, Lindsay McMahon, the English adventurer, and Michelle Kaplan, the New York Radio girl. Coming to you from Colorado and New York City, USA. In the last episode, we asked if the price of college in the US is worth it. Today, we give you four key vocabulary terms to start a conversation about this topic with a native speaker in English. How are you doing today, Michelle? How is life in New York City? I am good. It's actually a beautiful day today. I had to go somewhere this morning, so I took a walk. It was nice. I am good. I am good. It's beautiful here in Denver, Colorado as well. Feeling good.

0:01:21Michelle, on the episode last time, we were talking a little bit about asking the question, is college worth the price in the US? Prices are crazy. Hi. But today, when we talk about this topic, I feel like this is something we might talk about. Our listeners might talk about in English with friends or native speakers. What do you think? It's a very, very common topic. I think a lot of people have many opinions to share. A lot of things that they want to learn. This is something that comes up for sure. This definitely comes up. So guys, in this episode, we're going to give you four solid phrases that you need to have this discussion yourself. Because the whole point of all of English is connection, not perfection. We want you to be able to take these tools and go out and connect with a native speaker in English or anyone in English, right, Michelle? Exactly. Exactly. Very good.

0:02:13Point, Lindsay. So yeah, these are words or expressions that you can use in these conversations. So very, very useful. Should we get into the first one? Yeah, let's go for it. What is that first one, Michelle? The first one is an adjective. It's prohibitive. Oh, I love that one. Hibitive. It's kind of fun to say. Prohibitive. Yeah, it kind of rolls off your tongue. And this means something that is just too expensive to be able to purchase. When I was living in New York, it did feel like a lot of things in New York City were prohibitive. What do you think, Michelle? Yeah, yeah. I think it's a famous city for prohibitiveness. Although, you know what city is really prohibitive? It's Tokyo. I mean, you visited Japan. You and Dan took a trip to Japan, right? I have been there. Yes, it was. It was expensive there for sure. Yeah, I really felt like it was prohibitive. But anyways, these cities are just world-class cities and you've got to go anyways.

0:03:10So how does this fit into education? Here's an example, guys, write this down. The cost of education in the US has become prohibitive. And I kind of agree with that. I think 20 years from now, I just don't think kids are going to be able to afford to go to college. It's a little bit scary how quickly the prices move up. I know. Can you think of any other industry where the prices move up that fast? Oh, there's got to be something, but I feel like education is yeah, very, very high on the list. What do you think? It's kind of crazy. So it's completely prohibitive. And guys, before we move to the next word, Michelle, let's remind our listeners what they should make sure they do so they never miss an episode of All Ear's English.

Well, it basically means that with something as worth it, it means the reward justifies the cost of doing something. So let me give an example. Is it worth it to eat that piece of chocolate cake? Usually it is. My answer is always yes. Well, I mean, or I mean, there's a lot of things you can use, but you could say is college worth it or was is it worth it to buy the book or to buy the paper copy or should I use an online copy? Something like that. Like the amount of effort you put into something or about a money you put into something is justified. Yeah, that's a good example. Or just another example as you guys are having this conversation in English about the cost of college, you might talk about living on campus versus living off campus. So is it worth it to live on campus? Yeah, right. The price is so high eating in that the dining hall where the food is usually not that good.

0:05:18So is it worth it? Yeah, exactly. So yeah, the next one is advantageous. This is another adjective. So this is something that puts you ahead of others. So it gives you extra help. So for example, going to college can be advantageous for learning a language as advantageous. Guys, these are impressive vocabulary words. I have to say you're taking the aisles exam or if you are just talking to a native speaker and you start throwing around words like prohibitive and advantageous, it just is really advanced and this will help you connect with that speaker. Okay. So good. And now we have a fun one. We have a another idiom Michelle. Yes, what is it? It's to pound the pavement. So this is an idiom and it means to work hard to reach your goals. I mean, I think literally about like going around New York City, just like, you know, walking with like very heavy footsteps. That's just what I think of. But yeah, it's just working hard, right? So for example, to get what you want in life, you need to pound the pavement. Yeah, and I could imagine this on a college campus. Maybe you need to join all these different clubs. Maybe you need to be the president of the business club, right? So that's the literal example in the in the university world to pound the pavement up and down campus. But Michelle, you and I have the same picture of this idiom. When I think of this idiom, I think of trying to find my apartment in New York in 2006.

0:06:44My roommate and I, we were just literally running up and down downtown, downtown, uptown, because you know, on using Craigslist at that time, something became available uptown. So we run uptown and downtown. And then finally you sign and you have to sign in like five minutes. You can't think about it. It was, but I know you really got to get moving quickly on that. You got to move. You got to move. So that's the New York experience. And guys, these completely apply to life in New York, life in the US, or of course, talking about college, right? The experience of being in college in the US. So good. So good. Good. Oh, my gosh. Lindsay, this was fun. I'm glad we talked about this. Yeah.
