Once you achieve your goals in English and life, get a simple and foolproof framework to break down your goals and make them achievable so that you can be successful in life.

Hey Michelle, do you have, are you having a good day? How's the hour things? I am having a good day. I'm having a good day Lindsay. I'm happy. We've recorded a lot today. We've got a lot of...

0:01:44I'm a... I'm a... I've basically been on the phone all day. Oh, no. But with breaks in between, so then it feels like a new day every time, but it's still the same day. It's like a groundhog day that's in place with the same day. I know, but honestly, I can think of worse things because I love recording and you usually have a pretty good time. So it's all good. It's all good. It is definitely good. I would rather be doing this than many. Pretty much any other kind of work. Okay, I love that. Well then, we're on the same page there. Michelle, I want to start today off with a quote for listeners. Are you ready? Yeah. So here it is, guys. Action is the foundational key to all success. And if this was said by Pablo Picasso, so we know that we can take him seriously because the thing is artist. Right? Anyone that has that level of art, we've got to take them seriously. Okay. Exactly. Exactly. So, yeah, I mean, Lindsay, I feel like you have a lot to say about this because, you know, was starting all your English, starting businesses, you know, you, I think a lot of people when they want to start a business, when they have a new idea, they kind of freeze.

0:02:53And I know you are very much about taking actions, that right? Yeah, for sure. For sure. Well, you know, it helps with this podcast because we're so dedicated to our listeners. We know that you guys are ready for our episodes four days a week. So that's the key, right? Is setting up goals that are smart and setting up a schedule. So you're not stuck in this sort of analysis paralysis, right, Michelle? Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Really just get things done. I mean, guys, when you spend time just thinking about things, you're really spending all this energy that you could actually use to do the thing. Instead of think about it. So you know, you want to think about like, what is the key action that you're going to take tomorrow? So if you have a big goal, a really good thing is to break it down into smaller steps and use smart goals. Lindsay, what does that mean? Okay, here we go. So guys, write this down. This is your framework. It's a classic framework. You may know it, but we're going to break it down into one example. So smart means specific, measurable, achievable, reasonable, and timely or time-based. I like time-based. It has to be rooted in some kind of time.

0:04:05Okay. So it's not about being inspired to create your work, right? It's about being on a schedule and saying, I'm going to do XYZ. So you do it. Yeah. That's all it is. It's actually pretty simple. It's simple, but like somehow, you know, it seems so complicated to people sometimes. I think it's life and thinking. Yeah, thinking. Thinking gets in our way. So let's take a look at, you know, let's bring this into an example. And I can use the example of what we're working on right now, Michelle. We're creating a business English grammar course. This is going to be really cool for our global professionals who listen to this show and they need business English, but they need to work on their grammar for business English. All right? Exactly. Exactly. Okay. I love it. Very exciting. This episode is brought to you by Colloxil. For soft-come-free stools use Colloxil with center, the pink one that softened stools and encourages bowel movement to give reliable love and night relief. It's Stefan with everything you need to know about stools. Now I don't want to push it, push it too hard, but I've even made a Stefan stool playlist to help you get good feeling. So try Australia's number one constipation taboid brand Colloxil.

0:05:19Softened stools relieves constipation. Always read the label and follow the directions for use. All right. So let's break this down when we say specific, but S in the smart. What does this mean? Yes. Specific that you have to know exactly what your goals are. It can't be like, it can't be very general. It can be like, oh yeah, we'll get, you know, something in this range. It's like, oh today I will write three pages of my proposal. Yeah, exactly. So it's a number, right? It's exactly how many things are going to do. How many lessons are you going to complete? And so you write that down. And then it goes into the next piece, which is measurable, which is kind of where the numbers come in. Right. More so, right, Michelle? So 10 lessons, five versus you're going to write, whatever would be some other examples of how to measure things. Uh, three, uh, uh, three hours of transcriptions. Oh yeah. I mean, we're going to record, you know, 10 minutes of an all-ers English podcast episode, right? That could be one. Right. Right. Yeah. What about the next one? Achievable. Yeah. Can you, it is something that you can do, you know? If you're going to put something on there, that's just totally whack off like you. You know, that's just not, not realistic. It's not going to happen. You want to put on something that you really do feel like is achievable. We want to have, we want to set our sights high. But when you know, setting these goals, it's just helpful to be a little bit also realistic, I think. Yeah. And I like that bonus word for your listeners that you use just wack, I mean, crazy, right? Crazy. I heard a little New York accent come out there, Michelle. I love that. I love. I think of them even from New York, but my parents are so I think I have a ton of times anyway. There you go. Your parents live in New York, your parents are from New York. You've got New York in your blood. That's, that's true.

0:07:16All right. And then the next one is reasonable. This is similar to achievable, but how is it different? Is there any way it's different? Um, I feel like Lindsay, you have to enlighten me on this. I don't know. I was going to see if you had any ideas. I don't actually know. I feel like they are very similar, achievable, reasonable. Yeah, I think they're pretty similar. We're just going to say just reinforcing you have to be able to achieve it. Maybe reasonable means it makes sense for the overall goal. Like what you're doing makes sense in the context of the huge, the larger goal you're trying to achieve. Like for example, if our goal is to publish this course, I'm not going to go and record and record a YouTube video because that has nothing to do with the course, right? I'm going to do lesson one in this course. That's reasonable to do that. That's what I would say. Yeah. Yeah. I think that makes sense, Lindsay. And then the last one is timely. What do we mean by that? Or you said time-based? Yeah. So you have to say within a certain amount of time, this is so important. You're going to get lesson one done. You're going to get three pages and lesson one done, but by when? By when? That's the key by Friday. By Wednesday at two. What's the time? The more specific, you can be the better. Right, right, right. Oh my gosh. Smart goals. Good stuff. Yeah, Michelle. It's all about the smart goals. So we can finish up with that today. Guys, make sure you follow all our English and we will be back for the next episode very soon. All right, Lindsay. Thanks for hanging out. I'll see you on the next one. All right. Take care. Bye. Bye.
