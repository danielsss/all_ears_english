We do have a lot of healthy eating options if you look for them, but there's a lot of unhealthy food going on in the US. What do you think? We shot. Yeah, there's certainly a lot of unhealthy food and the problem is that the unhealthy food is the cheaper food. That's the pro, and we could go into another episode. We should actually talk about the concept of a food desert. That's what I was thinking. Yeah, food desert. There are places, for example in Manhattan and Harlem or Washington Heights that are food deserts. That comes back to sociological issues, poverty, and very difficult situations that need to be solved.

0:02:33
Michelle, where your only option is McDonald's. Today we're talking a little bit more broadly about just how to eat healthy. I was just in Nashville. Actually, just before that, unfortunately my dad was in the hospital. He did end up having a triple bypass heart surgery. Oh my God. And some of this is due to genetics that we have something in our family, but some of it is due to diet sadly. And I came right from the ICU, seeing my dad being under the knife, and this incredibly, fortunately, common surgery to going straight to Nashville. And when my dad came out of the hospital, the doctor gave him very, very, very specific restrictions on how much salt, specifically how much salt he could have in each item, each food item, no more than 200 milligrams of salt per food item that I bought at the grocery store for him. And then I went to Nashville and it was a salt bomb. The food was, I woke up, my face was swollen because I had too much salt. Like it was.

0:03:29
Yeah, I was. So you could see what's happening in our country. Right, Michelle? What are your thoughts on that? Well, can your dad go to a restaurant anymore? Or he really, he has to like not really not. Yeah, that's what I was most like. Because he don't know. Yeah, he feels, that's the problem when you go to restaurants. I mean, obviously, you guys, if you're healthy, you know, you feel like your general health situation is in your control, you should go to restaurants, you should enjoy life. But yeah, at some point, he really can't. He has to lose weight and he just needs to be really careful because they do throw a lot of salt in. Yeah, oh my gosh, there's so much salt in everything like, sometimes I can't believe it, because I do look at the nutrition labels for sodium.

0:04:06
It's one of the things because I know that that's a big, you know, health thing. Yeah. And it's sometimes scary when you see it and it's something where you wouldn't even realize. It's terrifying. Like, for example, before this whole thing happened, before I went to help my dad, I was buying feta cheese and I was having feta cheese every day on my salad. And then I looked at the salt content and it's over that amount. And so I stopped putting feta cheese on my salad. Cheese is something that's sort of borderline healthy, slash not healthy, but it was like a little bit of a guilty pleasure. Yeah, we don't quite know. I didn't think it was that bad, but then I saw the salt and I thought, so that's just for a very picky diet. But let's talk about Michelle. Like, what are some things that Americans do eat, especially for breakfast, because I think that's the most important meal of the day.

0:04:51
Yeah, I mean, well, things that are very popular, pancakes, waffles, people eat a lot of bacon, and eggs, or it, let's see what else. oatmeal, muffins, English muffins, which is what you had today. Yeah, it's a really good choice, actually. Thank you. So calorie, much better than a bagel, for example. So bagels are the next thing. Toast, coffee and juice, omelette, French toast, hash browns. I'd say sausage. What Michelle? Sorry. Sausage, too. Sausage. Yeah, I'd say 20%, 15% and 20% of this list is actually healthy. Yeah.

0:05:21
What do you think? Yeah, I agree. I mean, I feel like, you know, now if you want to be healthy, like, yeah, I mean, oatmeal is healthy. I think it's good to have a lot of fruit, you know, yeah, putting avocado was, of course, a good one. Oh, yeah. I eat a ton of avocado. Avocado is something. And in the last, like, 15 years, it's become really popular in our coffee. Oh, I feel like, in the 90s, no one knew what an avocado was. I know. I feel like I didn't. I don't remember my things, such a big deal, then. It's true.

0:05:50
And I actually, nowadays, I eat a lot of, I'm eating a lot of more nuts, like almonds and walnuts and things, because that gives you some really good vitamins and stuff. But I mean, so if we're visiting the US, or let's say a lot of our listeners are working in the US, they're living here. This is life every single day. What are some tips, Michelle, of how we can stay healthy? I think we have three or four things we could recommend. Yeah. Right? Well, I think one is, you know, trying to avoid, you know, things like the drive-through, like that fast food. I mean, I'm guilty of it, too. It happens. Sometimes this is a convenient thing. But, I mean, like, I think trying to find, I mean, this is, it's hard to say, because not everyone has the time.

0:06:29
But if you can, you know, go into a restaurant or sit out tied of a restaurant and order there. And, you know, I think that trying to avoid fast food is not just possible. Yeah. I mean, the good news is, now things have become a lot more, well, there, so a couple of months ago, I drove from Colorado back to Boston. That was a big mistake. But if you try to eat anywhere in the rust belt, like you can't find anything but McDonald's, McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken. But in some parts, like in Colorado, probably around New York City, around Boston, you can find chains, like sweet greens, places where you can actually get more of a fast casual, where you can actually, it's fast. You just go in, it takes a little longer than the McDonald's drive-through, but like five minutes longer, and you can get a salad. Right, right, right, right, right. Exactly.

0:07:20
There's a lot of that stuff now. Yeah. Yeah. So, Alindzi, another thing is about beverages, and I feel like, I'm rolling my eyes out of you right now. Because we were just talking about this, how you drink your coffee black, and I had some cream, and yeah, you know, well, aren't you wonderful? No, I'm just okay. That's okay. Don't worry about that. But yeah, I have my tibetations. I have my tibetations. If you put chocolate and, you know, peanut butter ice cream in front of me, I probably eat a whole tub of Ben Jerry's. Okay, I feel better.

0:07:51
I feel better. Yeah, so, but getting, you know, a lot of the drinks are very sugary, huh? Yes. And you don't realize, you know, I think a lot of times people don't count their beverages, like in their, you know, health. They think, oh, well, I'm drinking it. So, for some reason, it doesn't count. But there are so many things, especially in popular coffee shops, you know, where it's with tons of milk and sugar. And so, you know, consider that too. Well, and also just the fact that our sizes are so huge. When I lived in Tokyo, I actually did sometimes go to Starbucks, right in Shibuya, there was a Starbucks in Shibuya. And I would order a small coffee, like the smallest size, and it would be in eight ounce.

0:08:33
And in the US, we don't serve the eight ounce, unless you ask for it. You have to ask for the eight ounce. If you say small, you'll get a 12 ounce. So, is that, is that small? Yeah, 12 out of the small in, yeah, unless they've changed it. I don't, I don't, I don't, I, I mostly just have coffee from home. Yeah, well, I mean, there's just no doubt that the sizes in the US are bigger than probably in both countries in the world. So, that's a problem. So, you're not just like getting a lot, getting sugar in your coffee, you're getting a lot more sugar in your coffee, right? But, you know, just do what you can, do what you want. We can always change our sense of taste. When I first started drinking black coffee, I was disgusted, but now I like it.

0:09:10
So, that can change too, right? Oh, exactly, exactly. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. What's the next one, Michelle? Eat protein, eggs, yogurt, not, you know, watch your carbohydrates. I mean, there's a simple and the complex, I don't know. There's this, now I'm not an nutritionist, but try oatmeal, that's another good one, because that keeps you full. So, really thinking about adding some protein, that will kind of curb some of the hunger that would normally happen much sooner. Exactly, but be careful, though, because even oatmeal, if you, if you eat like the packets, the packets, they could be sugar bombs.

0:09:46
Yeah, sugar bombs, just as bad as that in cocoa puffs. Yeah. That's true. So, be careful, there's hidden sugar everywhere in the US. So, that's why it is good to be able to eat breakfast at home, make your own, just be really clear, like, how much sugar am I actually getting? Even if this product is positioned as a healthy option, like granola, everyone thinks granola is healthy, but it's got a huge amount of sugar. Yeah, I agree with that, actually. Yeah. And then another thing, this is an interesting one. Take lunch for breakfast. Let's see, what do you, why is that good idea?

0:10:19
I mean, it kind of makes sense if you go into a breakfast like a diner, let's say, and these diners are so fun, they're so American, they're so great. Yeah. But they can be really greasy. You know, if you see on the menu, all you see is greasy sausage, bacon, waffles, syrup, sugar. And then you look over, they may also serve lunch, you see maybe sandwiches, maybe a salmon, smoked salmon, or something, something a little better. You might go for that instead of a greasy breakfast. Yeah.

0:10:47
Right, right, right, exactly. Yeah, I think that's an interesting cool tip that I haven't thought of. Yeah, or even a salad, I mean, why not? Why not have a salad for breakfast, right? I mean, I suppose if you, but I love breakfast food, I love a good waffle, like piled high with sugar-y food. So don't give up your pleasures, right Michelle? Exactly, exactly. Don't go crazy, you know, but overall, try and think healthy. Yeah, I think when it comes to eating in the U.S., it's really about what you do every day. It's not about what you do on the weekends.

0:11:22
Right. It's not about what you do once a week, even twice a week. It's about what you do every single day for every single meal. So as long as you are, you know what you're eating, how much sugar and fat you're consuming. You're going to be on the right track. Awesome. I love it. This is, and I'm starving now. Now that we've talked about it. Oh my gosh, have you not had breakfast yet? I did, but this was just making me hungry.

0:11:44
