How are you? What's new? Oh my God, not a whole lot, not a whole lot, but lately I've actually been thinking about language exchanges.

0:01:42I've done a lot of language exchanges in my life. Michelle, what languages have you learned in your life? I've learned a little bit of French. I've learned some Hebrew. I've learned a little bit of Spanish. But I'm not fluent in any of them, unfortunately. Lindsay, you're the one. You've probably done a lot more. Oh my God, I know what you have. Compared to the polyglot of the world, I've done nothing. But I can say, yeah, I've learned French as you have. So Spanish and Japanese are kind of the languages that I've worked on in my lifetime. And I've found that the immersive method always works best. Tell us about the language exchanges. What's involved? Tell us. Oh my gosh, this is such a core piece of your language learning plan, guys. So when I was living in New York, I really kicked it up with the language exchanges. I actually found people on different websites, language websites, even Craigslist. If you find someone Craigslist, always meet in a public place. Please, right? Okay, that's my tip. But I would meet language exchange partners who spoke Spanish. I met up with a guy from Peru, someone from Colombia. We would just sit in a cafe after work and just speak in Spanish for an hour or half an hour and speak in English for an hour or half an hour. So we would split that time. Right, Michelle? That's really what a language exchange is. How cool. That is so cool. So I mean, Lindsay, I'm going to call you the language exchange pro. I mean, if our listeners want to get involved in the language exchange, what are some important things for them to remember? Yeah. So this has to be done right. And I think a lot of you at this point are going to go online for this. And we'll give you some ideas of where to go and how to do it. It just makes more sense sometimes to do this from home, the way the world is. But yeah, there are two things you have to make sure you do.

0:03:34The first one is that you have to make sure that your partner corrects your mistakes immediately. But Michelle, should your partner correct all of your mistakes? What do you think? I don't think so. I mean, this kind of goes back to what I learned. I have a master's. I agree with you, Saul. And I would say a resounding no. Okay, resounding no. That's good. Okay, tell us why. What did you learn in your master's program? What do we need to know about this language? Well, the idea is, I mean, listen, I will say that I learned about it from a teaching side. Like a real teacher's point of view, not necessarily thinking about this from the language exchange point of view. Now, a lot of times people want everything to be corrected, right? Like any mistake at all as a teacher, I really focus on what am I teaching or what are the main things and correcting those things, like correcting what you're actually working on. But there's a lot of different ideas about your corrective feedback and research done. And what's the best way to do it? So sometimes I might make a bunch of notes as a student is speaking and then at the end, choose some of the most important ones. Or do you stop in the moment? So, I think in a language exchange it might be a little bit different. But overall, I think correcting every single one is this kind of inhibiting fluency. And if you correct everything, then it's like, it can be distracting, right? So if you're talking and I'm like, let's eat no, no, no, it's this. I can't even talk now. Yeah, and that's kind of defeating the purpose, I think. I think that's such a good perspective. It's so true. Guys, so we want you to avoid the temptation to tell your partner correct every mistake. We know you think that's what works. That's actually not what works. So then Michelle, since there's not going to be a lecture from a teacher to start off the lesson, there's not going to be any textbook. There's not going to be an introduction to a tense. How could the two partners talk through what the maybe it's a conversation about what your language goals are? Or maybe you do bring in some extra material as a partner to say, this is what we're going to work on today. I do think there needs to be a little bit of extra intentionality in the language exchange for show. Yeah, I think so too. It's good to have a goal. Even if you say, like, oh, the first five minutes are totally just free talk. That's already a little plan. But maybe you say, okay, today we're going to read the newspaper or today we're going to talk about a TV show we watch or podcasts we listen to.

0:06:11And that could be something there. Or maybe you say, like, we're going to practice telling stories today from our childhood or travel stories. And they're you're saying, okay, we're going to be kind of focusing on the past tense there, right? Yeah. So you can kind of choose things that bring about maybe a particular grammar point or vocabulary area vocabulary that you want to work on. Yeah, so I think it's good to have some goals like that. And it's really cool if you're at the same level as your partner. Now you don't have to be right because I could be working with someone who is advanced in English, but I'm a beginner in Spanish. That's okay. Right, but it's cool if you're at the same level because then you can say this is the topic we're both working on today. First we're going to do it in English and then we're going to work on in Spanish. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. This episode is brought to you by Colloxil. For soft, comfy stoos, you use Colloxil with Senna, the pink one that softens stoos and encourages bowel movement to give reliable, low-venight relief. It's Stefan with everything you need to know about stoos. Now I don't want to push it, push it too hard, but I even made a Stefan stool playlist to help you get good feeling. So try Australia's number one constipation tab at Grand Colloxil. Soft and stoos relieves constipation. Always read the label and follow the directions for use. But I think what it comes down to is you guys in an exchange with a partner, it's on you as the person taking control of your learning to come into that that session with the guidance because it's not your partner's responsibility. You're not paying them anything. They're just showing up and they're willing, they're native speakers. They're willing to correct you, but they're not going to guide as a lesson. So you need to guide it yourself. That's, you know, that's the first tip. Right. That's kind of the second tip to Michelle, but in a different way. Right. Right. Right. You know, I think one of the challenges is when we get one on one stuff, we end up just doing small talk. That's the second, that's the first, the second problem that we're trying to solve here. What's the problem with small talk? I mean, I think that it's good, but you also want to get deeper than small talk. Small talk is very like, oh, hey, how's the weather, right? It's easy. So I think that, you know, getting into those deeper, deeper conversations is very important. It's more real life. Yeah. I mean, I can tell you that in my Spanish, I hit a real plateau. And I think a lot of our listeners, you guys are at this plateau where you can, you know exactly what to say.

0:08:31You have all the structures for the easy service level small talk, but when someone asked you to talk about politics in the Middle East right now, it's going to get a lot harder. So that's why we want you to at first, it's okay. The first 10 minutes do all the small talk you want talk about the weather, your family, your weekend. Okay. But don't let the whole session be about your weekend because then you're just repeating the same structures you already know how to use. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. That's a good point. So let me wear some places that our listeners can go for a language exchange. Oh my gosh. Well, I think a great place is eye talky. Okay. So I've actually done my own language exchanges on eye talky before we traveled to Paris last fall. I hired some language exchange partners on eye talky to work where there was great. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. What are you doing? Do you know of any others? I hear there's a live mocha my language exchange. Yeah. There's Craigslist you could find someone or something called the mixer or meetup or maybe even your local university has a language exchange program. Yeah. There's lots of places guys and now more and more more of these platforms are coming online. So take on yourself to find your partner, but just guide the exchange in the right way. Take control of what you actually do in that session. I think that's the key Michelle. Awesome. Okay. Lindsay, this was fun.
