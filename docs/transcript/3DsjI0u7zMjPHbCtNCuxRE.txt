Oh? Not really much going on over here recording a podcast. That's fun. Oh well glad to hear it So you started the episode just now by saying not much going on So we're talking about the phrasal vert all phrasal verbs first of all which is a big topic for our listeners But phrasal verbs with go today Yeah, it's gonna be a quick simple easy lesson for you guys just to get some immediate vocab you can use with native speakers right away So as you guys know that phrasal verbs are one of the hardest things about learning a language when there's Collocations with different words that change the meaning right yeah depending on what prepositions are added to the verb go It changes the meaning and you have to be aware of these so that you understand and can Communicate and can use phrasal verbs when you speak yeah, it's so true I mean you work a lot one on one with students with all those English students already do students ask you a lot about phrasal verbs specifically. I mean today. Oh, yeah Oh, well, and it's interesting because for IELTS phrasal verbs are a little too informal for like writing task two Okay, you definitely want to be using them on speaking to get that variety of vocabulary You need especially in part one because they are more informal right but they are they're hard to learn often Well, have a student just give me a few and say explain to me the differences because I've googled these and there's all this Information and I still don't really understand so we'll go over example sentences just like we're gonna go over today And today's podcast to make sure that you understand how to use these yeah And so what do you tell students in terms of how to learn them or should we be learning them in conversation and context should be Memorizing them how do we learn these yeah, so there are different strategies you have to learn them in context If you add a phrasal verb to like a vocab list a vocab notebook You have to include it in a sentence a couple example sentences with some like the you know the meaning of course And then use it right away. That's a key with learning new vocab don't leave it to gather dust on a list Use it when you speak until you're very comfortable with it and understand what it means and are confident using it Yeah, we definitely don't want our notes gathering dust definitely don't get it in regret And get it useful make use of it engage in the with the world using those words So let's go into it. Let's give our listeners three phrasal verbs that they can write down today Using go so what's the first one today?

0:03:50
Yeah, the first one I actually just used without thinking about it to go over right and talking about how we're going to go over these phrasal verbs today Means you're going to discuss them explain them Cover talk about them right it just means you're going to provide some information Yeah, I think this is one that teachers use a lot in the classroom right and let's go over the homework from last night Right, you know kids come in with their homework that kind of it really makes me think of school this phrase over Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I think it's one of those things now that you have learned what it means you'll hear it everywhere Like in class if you're taking an online class You're definitely going to hear your teacher tell you this okay It's time to go over this the results of this exam exactly. I love that and then the next one is to go through Now how is this different This episode is brought to you by Colloxil for soft comfy stools use colloxal with center the pink one that softened stools and encourages bowel movement to give reliable love and night relief It's Stefan with everything you need to know about stools now. I don't want to push it push it too hard But I've even made a Stefan stool playlist to help you get a good feeling So try Australia's number one constipation tabitre grand Colloxil softened stools relieves constipation always read the label and follow the directions for use So this is more in detail right if you're going to go through maybe a contract Where you're going to break things down line by line?

0:05:16
This is very much, you know, you're getting into the nitty gritty details of something if you say let's go through this here Yeah, that's true. Yeah, I was just reading through let's see a good example Would be on Sunday we almost bought a house last week. We didn't buy a house. We almost did And so we needed a family member to go through the contract with us in a lot of depth because it's the first time I've never seen a mortgage contract before right Yeah, and so to go through every line. What does this mean? What does this mean? It completely freaks me out? Yes, I know that's a big it's a big decision. You don't want it It's kind of scary to sign your life away and it's a stack of papers two inches tall Like can I really read this word for word? Yeah, and then I get kind of bored. I tune out and I'm like I can't tune out I have to read what this is because it's matter He's to know what's oh my gosh. What am I agreeing to what am I signing off on? So anything that requires that level of depth you want to go through it right? You're not so much going over it You're going over it too, but you're really going through it because through implies Through implies immersion kind of yes Exactly really immersing yourself in something and we also use this Talking about practicing something if I were if I would go through a piece on the piano I'm like okay. I'm gonna go through this really quick. It means I'm practicing it I'm playing it. I'm gonna play it over and over and over until I know it well. Okay, so in that case It could also mean to practice something to or if you have your maybe you're an actor an actress and you're getting ready to go on You go through your lines right or I just go over to but yeah, so these are very similar guys They're interchangeable go over and go through but this is good. This is good It's just a level of detail. I feel like right if you're like okay. I got to go over my lines really quick I'm about to go on whereas maybe the night before you would go through your lines with another person in detail Right and I think about the contract you were talking about if you were like I'm gonna go over this contract They are not really talking about a level of detail there Yeah, but if you're gonna really go through the contract you're reading every page completely that is so good All right, we've got one more go phrasal verb for listeners and this one's fun because It's all about action right taking action. What is it up?

Yeah, that's so good go for it Right, maybe you've set an ambitious goal something you want to do you want to I don't know we want to change Industries working in a new field. Do you want to do something exciting your friends would say yeah, you should really go for it Go for it. Yes, and we also use this a lot like if we're eating out if we're choosing what we would eat at a restaurant You might say what are you gonna go for you say I'm gonna go for the spaghetti right and that's another way of saying I'm going to choose this is what I'm going to choose to eat. This is what I'm gonna go for right and then you know You might ask someone's opinion and they might have I haven't tried it but go for it right go for it There's that chunk too a lot of chunks going on here that we want you guys to know and to use and also to listen for You're gonna hear these out there in the world of native English speakers So write them down when you hear them right exactly right use them use them in context Practice intentionally with us speaking partner We like let's let's go over these new brazil verbs.
