Hey, Michelle, what's shaking? Hey, Lindsay, not too much. Not too much. How are you? Oh my gosh, I'm excited to be back here today on All-Ears English. Guys, if you are not following, if you have not hit follow or subscribe to All-Ears English, to this show, make sure you do it. Michelle, what are we talking about today? Okay. Well, today, this is an interesting topic, really.

0:01:53
It's going to be talking about training your brain to speak real English. I mean, Lindsay, what do we mean by that? Yeah, well, first of all, we know that you guys, and that's why we created All-Ears English, because we know that you guys are tired of the old way, the classrooms, the textbooks, the memorization, the obsession about grammar. Right? So, the first thing is we change our mindset about the way, but why we're learning. Michelle, why are we learning English to begin with? I believe that we're looking to connect with people. We're looking to build relationships. Yeah. Yeah, we're looking to connect guys. Like we said, connection on perfection. So when we think about why are you learning English, I mean, I think for so many people, I mean, myself, when I've been trying to learn other languages, probably Lindsay for you, it really, when it really comes down to is this connection.

0:02:45
Mm-hmm. Exactly. Exactly. And then, so we know why. And that already will move you way ahead of the game, guys, if you know exactly why you're learning, right? Because there's a new motivation. Now we're thinking about the people. Right. We're not thinking about the grammar constructions anymore, right, Michelle? I love that. Definitely. It is really just a new outlook. So, you know, I mean, the way that you learned English when you were in school, and you're little, or maybe how you're learning now, sitting with the textbook, guys, that's, you know, we want to take a new approach.

0:03:18
We want to have a new angle on this. So, Lindsay, we have a quote that we wanted to share, right? Exactly. Here we go. So, here's the quote for today. Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think. And that's by the famous Albert Einstein. Michelle, I feel like Albert Einstein has had a lot of quotes. He's had a lot of quotes and a lot of things. Yes. Yes. And this is a really great one. I mean, yeah. So, not learning of the fact, the training of the mind to think. So, this makes me think of like history class.

0:03:50
I was actually just discussing this with someone the other day. Okay. So, because when I remember, I was in history class and I would just learn to learn. I would learn to memorize it to pass the test. And it worked. You know, that worked. But did I retain it? Did I actually learn how to think? Right. I think that's kind of, and now when I look back on it, I'm kind of, I kind of feel like, oh, I wish I had paid more attention. I wish I had learned in a different way rather than just learning to memorize. Exactly. You know, I did the same thing. And it worked for me too, right?

0:04:25
If you put in a decent amount of work into something, you can memorize anything. Even if you're, what the problem with that is that we're memorizing it completely out of context. I think that's the key here. You know, on this show, we want to show you English in context all about connection, all about people and how natives would use it in a real way, but your textbooks just show it to you in a very isolated, non-contextual way, right, Michelle? Right. Right, right, right. Exactly. So, guys, and now we need to try a new way, right? We need to learn by training the mind to think, like Einstein said, and learn in this, I think, a more genuine way. Exactly. You know, it makes me think of, you know, just going back to the history class stuff.

0:05:08
I mean, nothing, you know, I memorize the facts about, for example, you know, Germany in the 40s, right? But nothing could ever replace, for one thing, going to, oh, right now, where Anne Frank was hiding, right? That, that the, the annex, right? That famous place we're visiting, I don't know, Paris, and seeing the museums, like nothing can, can be a substitute for that because I'm seeing it in context, and I'm learning it kind of as a whole person. Everything, right? The smells, the sights, the sounds, all of these things. So guys, it doesn't mean you have to travel to the country or go to this museum. It means you need to envision the language in a real situation, right, Michelle? Exactly, exactly. And I mean, it makes me think also of just like, I like to play music. I mean, and I can, you know, go to, I mean, I could watch a music lesson.

0:05:55
I can watch a video, right? But I'm not going to learn it unless I have that hands-on experience, right? You can't just kind of learn something without actually doing it, getting your muscles engaged, memorizing things, getting that muscle memory. So that's just another thing. You can't replace that. Yeah, tell us a little bit, Michelle, about your experience with music. So what instrument, so do you sing, do you play instruments? Tell us if our listeners don't know you yet. We're getting to know you here on the show. Episode 45, tell us about your musical skills and how you learn music. Oh, I, so I play, I grew up playing flute and I play piano and I play guitar in some ukulele, but mostly out of all of those things I like to sing. So I would say that's like my number one and then the instrument's like, I dabble, you know.

0:06:48
Yeah. But as far as learning it, I mean, I took voice lessons. I, you know, I did all the lessons, but if I wasn't going to actually like, I think I would learn the most than from doing performances because there's something different. I mean, and this really goes to language learning too, I think about those nerves in the moment. Like when you're with your teacher or when you're just rehearsing, practicing, like you have like your breath is different, you feel more at ease, right? When you go in front of the audience, everything in your body kind of changes because you don't have the same breath control because no matter what, you're a little bit nervous. So you might not feel like if you want to hit a high note, you might feel more nervous and you might not have the breath. So going out and like preparing for that and learning how that actually feels. Ooh, that's a great example. Yeah. I like that idea.

0:07:39
Thank you. So yeah, for language learning is the same thing. It's like we can practice it with our textbooks, but then when we get out there, then our nerves come into play, right? So you have to learn by continuing to do that and getting used to that feeling. Like what does it feel like when I'm nervous, like what happens and kind of investigating that and seeing like what solutions you can find through practice? Yes, I love that. That is so good. So guys, make sure as much as you can go on stage, quote unquote, right? Yeah, right. You get a real world with your English. Try to interact. You can find language exchange partners online. There are ways to do this to make it real.

0:08:13
You're right, Michelle. Go on stage. I love that. That's the theme of today's episode. So good. Awesome. Awesome. Oh my gosh. This was fun.
