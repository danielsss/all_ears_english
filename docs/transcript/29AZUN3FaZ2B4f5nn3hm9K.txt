0:01:36I'm so excited to talk today about dating in America. Oh my gosh. What a topic. You know, nowadays. That's a fun topic. It's always a fun topic. This is going to be a fun topic. We both have experience with dating in the US and we are from the US. And I'm really curious about how dating works and other cultures around the world. But today we're going to give our two cents specifically on online dating. So when did online dating crop up, Michelle? When did it become popular in the US?

0:02:04Oh, any idea. Just take a guess. We don't know. Wasn't maybe like, to my, okay, I have to think. 2005. Yeah, maybe something like that, you know? I think that in the 90s, it was still very dark and no one was, it wasn't very accepted. But I think somewhere around the mid-Auts or the late-Auts, I love saying that, by the way. What does that mean, Michelle, for a listener's opponent? I, you're the only person I, I'm the only one that says that. I always, I heard you said that last time too. And like every once in a while, and I always forget about it.

0:02:36So what is that? That's the early 2000s right before the 10s. So the Auts, as far as I know, I hope I'm not saying this wrong. Oh my gosh. I got a double check. But the Auts are the, like 2000 to 2010. So that's what I figured. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the 2000s. You could also say, guys, the 2000s, that's fine. So anyways, we'll just do a check on that, follow up on another episode. Maybe we'll do a whole other episode, Michelle, on how to talk about the decades. But. That's fun.

0:03:03Yeah, I think, you know, sites like match.com, OK, QBIT, those became mainstream in the 2000s, I would say. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. And now, I mean, there's all the apps, right? What is it? Bumble. What is it called? Tinder. Oh my gosh. Tinder. Now I'm like, so I met my husband online. OK, so you have a story for us. Yeah, so I mean, yeah, we met on OK, QBIT. Oh.

0:03:33And yeah, I had been doing online dating for a little bit of time, and I actually hated it. I was like, I'm never going to meet anyone this way. This is like kind of an artificial way of meeting someone. And then I met my husband. Oh, that's amazing. And now, like, gave us a few details here. Did you? Now, how long did you guys message? That's always a question, right? How long did you message before you met up? Because everyone has a different philosophy on how to do this. I think just like we were back and forth a few times. So maybe, yeah, maybe like three back and forth. I don't know.

0:04:07I was kind of at the mindset, like, just like let's meet. Because you just can't really, I don't know, in my experience, like I bet you can't really tell unless you actually just meet the person. So you were like, you know, he wrote funny messages and things like that. And then it's like, OK, well, let's just meet. And we did. And now for Mary, that's amazing. I know everyone has a different philosophy. My philosophy, when I was online dating, was the same because I was living in New York. And I was like, I'm already in Manhattan. Let's just meet for a beer. It'll be easier than me going home.

0:04:38Why should I go home right hours of messages to you? And I may be completely wasting my time because I don't know if I like you or have me even attracted, right? Yeah. Right. I don't know. That's exactly how I felt about it. And it's just funny because now, you know, you're, I mean, so weird together almost 10 years. Wow. And then, oh my gosh, that's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. It's been a while, but now it's funny because I know, you know, like, certain family members of mine who are younger or actually friends too, who are single, who are looking, you know, they're more on these apps.

0:05:14And it's like, I don't really know anything about these. So I'm like left in the, you know, I'm like left in the old ages of online days. I don't even know if OKCupid is a thing anymore. I guess it probably is. Guys, that's the name of the dating site. But I mean, maybe we'll throw out some names. So we said, you know, a bumble is another one that's really common in the US. OKCupid. I don't know if E-Harmony is a thing anymore. I don't even know. I don't know. Yeah.

0:05:40Good question. And then there are sites for senior citizens. There's lots of things, but to me, it's just a way to, like, notice that someone gets someone on your radar and then as quickly as possible get them in person to see if there's an actual connection. Because how can you tell there's a connection in the messaging, you know? Yeah. I mean, yeah. I agree. So I wonder if that's more of the norm nowadays because on the apps, I think you probably also meet faster. Yeah. I mean, I know that it used to be, like, you know, you write these long letters.

0:06:13And then, you know, you can see if you like each other through the letters. But, like, to me, it was just never, I don't know. You can write all you want, but it can't replace that. Chemistry that does or doesn't exist when you meet a person. Well, and also the fact that our society has just become so much faster. Everything moves fast. So something like Tinder kind of makes sense for current day dating, right? It's just swiping. And are you attracted? I don't know. I've never used Tinder's. I don't really know.

0:06:39But I don't think there's a ton of messaging in there. I think it's very visual, which is hard too, right? Because you could get a liminator. You could eliminate someone that actually might be very attractive, but it's just that the photos weren't good or you didn't necessarily know that they're attractive. Like, the person has a great sense of humor, right? How could you know that until you're with them? And that adds a lot of points. I think that's the one drawback is, like, you know, you maybe swiping past like someone who you would really get along with. Yeah. Just because, oh, maybe you saw that you don't like their height or, you know, you become picky about some physical feature.

0:07:18And like, how do you met that same person? This is how I always felt. Like, how do you met that same person at, you know, some like, you know, book club or like, or some, you know, sports group or something that like was more organic. How do you met that person that way? Maybe you would have liked them, you know, because you got to know them first, but like just seeing a picture is so hard. So that's how that's why I always felt like it's never going to happen for me in that way. But then it does too. So it's like, it's kind of hard. You want to, you don't want to just be like, oh, I don't like this person's picture.

0:07:55Sure. Let me, me. But, you know, in that way, you do want to kind of maybe, maybe give people an extra chance. Yeah. I think what I'm taking away from this conversation and our advice for any listeners that might be in the US wanting to date around, right? Wanting to date and meet people is you kind of have to do both. Right? You have to be active in your world signing up because I'm at my partner at a camping weekend. Camping and hiking weekend for our doorsy people, right? And we probably wouldn't have met online. That's just the truth.

0:08:23Right. But at the same time, like you need to have your profile up and be messaging, yes, setting updates that way. And then you also need to be joining clubs going to events. So do both. Don't do one or the other. That's what I would say. Right. Right, right, right. Exactly. Oh my gosh. This is the fun topic. I'm sure we'll be talking more about dating on the show. Yeah. This is fantastic.
