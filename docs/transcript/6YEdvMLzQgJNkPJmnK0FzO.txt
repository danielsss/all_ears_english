Hi, Michelle. How's it going? How you feeling today? What's good? I'm good. I'm good. Yeah, I'm excited to be recording here today. We have a fun topic for today. I know. I'm so excited to be here with our listeners. Make sure you follow all ears, English, wherever you listen to this podcast. We published new episodes four days a week for you. So make sure you follow us. Michelle, today we're talking a little bit about vocabulary, right? Yeah, guys, we're going to teach you some tricks about expanding your vocabulary. So how can you quickly grow your vocabulary list and speak like a native? And this is going to help you with things like your everyday life, but also I also, so there's TOEFL, whatever you're taking. So this is definitely very important, just how to expand your vocabulary.

0:02:23Yeah, it makes me think of my time living in Tokyo, where I actually, in Japan, it's easy to find those little key chains where they have the little tiny cards. They're tiny little rectangular cards for flashcards. And they can go on your key chains. It's a brilliant idea. I don't know why we don't have them here in the US. Yeah, that would be great. Yeah, it's fantastic. And I think some people even put them on their phones. I don't know. But I would ride the train, you know, my day off to Shibuya, Shinjuku, wherever, and I would have all my kanji written on those cards. And I would just be able to easily study them and just flip through them really quickly. So the reason that works is that they were easy to grab and easy to make a part of my life in my commute, right Michelle? Right. So I feel like flashcards are a really good way to learn.

0:03:09Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 100% have you ever used flashcards in studying languages yourself, Michelle? If you have, I mean, I've put stuff around the room, you know, to label things. You know, all sorts of things. So it's fun. I mean, I think that's one of the tips for today. As you know, try putting your vocabulary flashcards in different areas of your home, right? So like put it on the fridge, you know, for a fridge. I mean, some of this stuff could be for words that, you know, pretty well, but some of it could be for new things. Like, you know, just think of, it doesn't just have to be about furniture. You know, it can just be about different things that it might remind you of something. It could be colors. It could be any minute. So you're saying it doesn't have to label the thing that it's stuck to.

0:03:57Is what you mean, right? I mean, I think that's the, you know, the way that most people do it. But I think, you know, get a little bit of, a little bit creative. Like maybe you, maybe there's a picture that you love that you have from a vacation. And there's a word that you think of that you associate with it. And like think of how that could be useful because you want to, in regular conversations, talk about your travel memories, things like this. So maybe there are some words that you can associate with that. And put those like nearby the picture. So that's a, that's kind of a step two way of doing it. I feel like step one is like labeling objects, things like that. But once you kind of master those vocabulary words, you can still make it challenging for yourself. This episode is brought to you by Colloxyl. For soft, comfy stools, use Colloxyl with Senna, the pink one that softened stools and encourages bowel movement to give reliable, low-vernight relief.

0:04:46It's Stefan with everything you need to know about stools. Now I don't want to push it, push it too hard. But I've even made a Stefan Stool playlist to help you get good feeling. So try Australia's number one constipation tabord brand Colloxyl. Softened stools relieves constipation. Always read the label and follow the directions for use. Oh, totally. And we have to know, I mean, especially if you're a visual learner like I am, when I lived in Japan, I put these all, so in addition to my little keychain flashcards, I had other flashcards all over my apartment. Tiny, tiny apartment, six tatami mats, so small, but I had words all over the place. And because I really wanted to learn, right? I just wanted to immerse myself and really understand the Japanese when I was there.

0:05:32So that's what it takes, guys. You really do. And especially if you're a visual learner, which I will kind of learn, are you? Would you say? I think I'm also, I'm a mix, but I definitely am visual as well. Okay, visual and verbal, would you say? Yeah, I think I like, I like kind of a mix of those too. But if I had to choose one, I would say visual. Visual, okay, got it. So yeah, so as we're saying, guys, put them all over your home on the wall. I even had them in my bathroom. Right, put them on your toaster, put them on your fridge, Michelle, what else? What else?

0:06:05Another thing you could do is instead of just like, we're talking about labeling things, this kind of goes along a little bit with what I was saying before to change things up. Write quotes and phrases that you like. So maybe there's a, there's a cool quote that you, that you heard in English that you like. Or I don't know, just maybe even there's a quote from a song or a TV show, something that makes you laugh. So put those on the wall on your index cards, wherever you want to put it as well. Yeah, and then I would just add to this as a final recommendation. Of course, now technology has moved forward, so we have digital flashcards, right? Right.

0:06:45You have apps like Onki, ANKI, right, which is a flashcard app. So it's not just a physical anymore, but it depends on how you learn. I learn well physically still. By touching things, having a piece of paper in front of me. But if you prefer apps, you know, apps like Dualingo have flashcards, check out the flashcard world on your phone. Yeah. Yes, I love it. All right, Michelle, this has been great. Such a good and concrete tip. And guys, remember, follow all, there's English.

0:07:18We're so excited to be here for you guys. All right, Michelle. Thanks for hanging out. Thanks, Lindsay, the host van. Have a good day. Bye. Bye. Thanks for listening to All Ears English.
