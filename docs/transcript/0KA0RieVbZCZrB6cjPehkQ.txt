0:01:39Yeah. Guys, nice to meet you. My name is Michelle Kaplan. I am from the Washington, D.C. area originally. However, now I live in New York. I love to travel. I also like to perform. I have done stand-up comedy. I've been in a band. I like to write songs and sing.

0:02:04So I really like all that stuff, but I also I love to teach. I've been teaching for years now. And I have my masters in teaching English as a second language. I really love working with students. So that's the short version of it. That's awesome. And I love that you are in New York City. Michelle, you and I share that in common. And I've also lived in New York.

0:02:29And you have lived in New York for the past 10 years or so, is that right? Yes, for a long time. I've been here. Oh my gosh. Yeah. I know a lot of our listeners are curious about what it's like to live in the city. And you're going to get a lot of insight on that, guys, on all-years English.

0:02:46And so that's why you should hit follow on this show to make sure you don't miss any of this awesome insight. So Michelle, shall I introduce myself? What do you think? Yes, I was going to ask you. Yes, yes, yes. All right, Lindsay, tell us about who are you. All right. So guys, my name is Lindsay McMahon. And I am an English teacher.

0:03:06And I'm also an entrepreneur. I love building companies. I love building businesses. I love understanding problems in the world and solving them. I love taking action. I also have a puppy. His name is Keefer. He's super cute. He's a little lab, Aussie mix. And we go hiking a lot.

0:03:26I like to take him outdoors. I'm all about skiing the winter, hiking in the summer, and traveling. So when I began my career as an English teacher, I lived in Japan for a year and a half. And I taught English there. And I learned Japanese. And then I went to South America. And I backpacked around South America for a year to learn Spanish.

0:03:45I lived in Guatemala. I lived in Argentina. And I did the community Santiago in Spain. So I've done a lot of great traveling, a lot of language learning. And of course, I lived in New York for a short stint. But now I'm here in the other English podcast. And so ready to share those experiences with you guys to motivate you to learn English in a new way. But Michelle, before we get into that new way, what we're doing here that's different.

0:04:12Let's talk about the weirdest snack recommendation. So yeah, okay, I learned something new. Yeah, tell me what is the weirdest snack? Because you, I've heard a few strange things about the snacks that you eat, Michelle. Tell us what is your weirdest snack recommendation that our listeners could try? Ooh, this is, I mean, can I share two? Two? Okay, I suppose you can.

0:04:37All right, okay, okay. Okay, well, one is peanut butter and cheese. Like I will eat like a peanut butter and cheese sandwich or or peanut butter and a deli meat. So like I will do like a peanut butter and turkey, you know, sliced turkey sandwich or something like that. So do you put me, so is it like the peanut butter is taking the place of the mayonnaise? Is that what's happening?

0:05:00I guess so. I don't know, I don't really like mayonnaise on my sandwich. So what I do is like peanut butter. So it kind of makes a little bit different. But the other thing is that I like to dip my popcorn in milk. So take a cup of milk next time you guys are having popcorn and dip your popcorn in it and then eat it and it's delightful. Ooh, that is so weird. Sagi popcorn?

0:05:25No. Yeah, it's like a cereal. No, it's not, it's not, okay, let's be clear. It, we don't dip like the whole thing in and like dunk it. Like, and then it's like totally, dunk it. Just do a little bit. You're gonna hear a sizzle, okay? And then you know that it's not a big deal. But it's very good. I love this.

0:05:42I feel like you have much corkier recommendations than I do. This is so good. Now, would you do this dunking thing? So you're not dunking, but you're sizzling it. Okay, would you do this thing? Like when you watch a movie, is that how you, you have your glass of milk here and then you have your popcorn? Yeah?

0:05:57Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's really good. It's really good. Guys, you gotta give it a try. I mean, Lindsay, you got anything good? I've got, well, I've got one thing that's very, it's, well, I'm just gonna say it. It is taking my spoon, you know this, Michelle. We know each other. I know.

0:06:12I know. Getting my spoon right into the peanut butter. What should the, in here, it's peanut butter clearly. Peanut butter. And just scooping it out. Sometimes even two scoops, maybe three of them feeling ambitious. But hey, I just love it. Just good, pure peanut butter. And I like the natural kind.

0:06:27I don't really like the, like the sake kind, like the Skippy is not my thing. Yeah. Just the natural peanut butter. And just a nice scoop of that. And then going off for a workout or something. So good, because you get that energy. Have you like crunchy or creamy? Oh my gosh, I actually like both. I don't discriminate.

0:06:41But I think if I had a choose, I'd probably go for the crunchy. I like that crunch. Love people don't like that though. I like, I'm also, I like both. But I think if I had to go for one, I would do the creamy. So that's what, I love it, I love it. So good. So guys, clearly we have some interesting recommendations. You should try those things.

0:06:58But you're gonna learn a lot on this show. Yes. About us, about American culture. About how to really connect. And let's tell our listeners what our vision is for this show. What is our slogan? What is our meaning? Why are we learning a show? You are gonna hear us say this all the time, but it's because it's so important and so useful.

0:07:16This is connection, not perfection. This is what all ears English boils down to. When you really think of this show, this is what it's gonna be guys. Let's see, what does connection, not perfection mean to you? So what it means is that your singular goal, the only reason we're all here, learning English, is to connect with a human being. If you really think about it, that's the point of learning a language.

0:07:38It's not about the grammar tables, it's not about memorization, it's not about your English teacher and a classroom. It's only about the person in front of you. In some cases, that means the audience in front of you, right, if you're giving a presentation. But many times it's just that person maintaining that eye contact, making that person laugh, and having that relationship.

0:07:57That's all, that's what we talk about on this show, right Michelle? Right, right, right. So if you are sitting here and thinking, oh well, I'm always like working with my textbook, I'm sitting in my room, my dorm room, or my apartment, by myself looking at my textbook and just memorizing things, there's a time and a place for that. But our belief here is that you will learn more, much more by getting out into the world and connecting with people and not worrying about, okay, oh no, did I supposed to have an S there?

0:08:27Or oh no, I like accidentally use the present test, tensor the past, obviously, this show also, we want to teach you correct English, and we will teach you correct the English, right? We are not going to say, eh, it doesn't matter, right? That's not what connection, not perfection is about. Exactly. That we're putting connection at the forefront. At the forefront, such a good word for our listeners for today's first episode, right?

0:08:53So guys, if you are a global business professional, you are going on business trips around the world, you're doing conference calls with your colleagues in English, or if you're an international student, maybe you're doing a PhD in the US or in England, Australia, this show is for you.
