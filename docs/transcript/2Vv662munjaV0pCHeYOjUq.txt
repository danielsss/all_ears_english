Michelle, thanks, giving! Oh my gosh, did you have a good one? I did, did you? I had a great one as usual. I ate too much food. I put on my turkey pants and I took a nap. That's good. That's good. Very typical American culture. Turkey pants, what does that mean? The stretchy pants that you wear for eating lots of food. Exactly. What's your favorite Thanksgiving dessert, Michelle?

0:02:01
I'll go with the pie. I'll go with an apple pie or... I'm not much of a pumpkin pie person, but I do like things with sweet potatoes, so I don't know if you would call it a dessert, but something that consists of sweet potatoes and marshmallows. I like that stuff. Oh, yum! That's a side, but it's so packed for the side. What about you, Lindsay? Yeah, I love the apple pie. I think that's got to be it, especially when it's really sweet and the apples are sweet. You know, they're not tart. They're just really, really perfect. Well, ice cream on the side, maybe some cool whip. It's so good. That is the best. Yeah, and then I'm happy all day. 

0:02:35
That's what I'm talking about. Turkey, I feel very neutral about the Mediterranean Bivalent. Me too. Very, very much. Michelle, how do you feel about Black Friday, the common shopping day out Thanksgiving? What do you think? Do you like that as much as the apple pie? No, I'm not. You know, it's for me whenever there's any big sale day, it just gives me anxiety because I don't think... I don't plan things ahead of time. I don't think ahead of time like, oh, what do I want? It just kind of sneaks up on me. So it could be that or like they have like that Amazon Prime Day. And it's like all of a sudden it's here. And I didn't think about what I wanted. And now I feel like if I don't get something, then I'm going to be losing all my money because I'll like... And then I just like get very, I don't know, very intense about it. And then I'm like, and then I end up just saying, forget it, I'm not buying any. Oh my gosh, Michelle, too much thinking. Yeah, exactly. So like start looking around and I'm like, oh, do I need this? I don't know. I wasn't, I didn't need it before, but it's on sale, you know? So I usually don't really heartaken in the sales. What about you, Lindsay? No, I usually avoid. I mean, if I'm going to do it, I'll do it online. I definitely will not go into a store on Black Friday. Although over the years, like online shopping's become so much more popular, right? For Black Friday, I would say probably most Black Friday shopping happens online now. So that's fine. But I would have to really, really know. The thing my problem is, I'm usually not organized for Christmas shopping by Black Friday. That's a whole month before. I don't have time. I'm never going to be, have a shopping list by then. It's just not going to happen.

0:04:14
I'm not that organized. Yeah, but people are so intense about Black Friday. I mean, guys, you must have seen like videos about the U.S. and the crowds and things like that. It's really not something that I want to be too involved with. Yeah. And I mean, I wonder if other cultures, I'm sure they have certain days. Guys, let us know about your culture. We want to know, are there certain days in the calendar that are big shopping days? And we've seen crazy things happen over the years. Like people getting trampled in stores, right, Michelle? In Walmart, different stores, because there are just so many people. Right. Right. I think something like that happened around the recession. And to the heat, I think I remember reading about that. It's so crazy. So Michelle, any strategies to navigate Black Friday if our listeners do decide to indulge in the shopping? 

0:05:31
Any strategy that I'm not so good on it myself, but I would say, I would say like, I mean, one thing that I want to remind myself is to kind of know what you're looking for. Like, because if you just lost, you know, it can get a little bit intense. But if you know, like I need, like for example, I just got a new dishwasher. That's a whole story in itself. But I just going to do your dishwasher. So if I knew ahead of time, like, oh, I'm going to need a new dishwasher, like, and Black Friday is coming up, then I would start like looking around like, what do I want?

0:06:03
Like what, you know, it's a good time for appliances too. Or if I want a new phone, anything like that. Then there's just the fun stuff, like clothes and whatever. So just I think be prepared to kind of know a little bit what you're looking for. That's my tip for myself. And load out. Yeah. Do you think, Lindsay? Well, I think you're right. I'm going to tag onto that, Michelle. I think that having a list and sticking to your list. Yeah. Because, you know, when things are cheaper, we always think, oh, just throw it on my card. It's so cheap. It's like the dollar store effect. Right? You know, the dollar store effect. If you go to the dollar store, everything's a dollar. And so you think you need things, but you actually don't need those things. Yeah. Right. So you end up coming home. You spend $20 on 20 items that you don't need. I mean, right. Right. Exactly. So being prepared is super important. So that would be my biggest tip. Yeah. I mean, American culture is just all about commercialization. And maybe that's going to change over the years, you know. I think that our culture's growing up. It's learning. It's it's figuring itself out. It's so young compared to your pink cultures and Asian cultures. Right, Michelle? Our culture. Yeah. For sure. For sure. So we will be interesting to see where Black Friday goes. It really well. Well, Michelle, thanks for hanging out today. Guys, if you are going out for Black Friday, be careful. wear a helmet. No.
