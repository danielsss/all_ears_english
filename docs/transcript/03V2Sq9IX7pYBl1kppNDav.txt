Excellent Michelle, I'm feeling great. What about you? I'm good, I'm good. Oh my gosh, last episode. We really got into it talking about breakfast foods and it was a very interesting discussion talking about nutrition in the US, especially dealing with breakfast. Oh my gosh, it was a good one. We could say so much more. We're going to go another day into this topic again, guys. The more sociological perspective of this for you guys. Go back and listen to episode 50 if you haven't heard that yet, but today we're going to break down some of the words that you need to know when you talk about food in American culture or in English when you talk with native speakers about this. Right, right, right. Exactly.

0:02:08
We got some good vocab for you today. So, guys, the first one is I use this a lot. Heavy food. When you describe a food as heavy. Now, does that mean it just weighs a lot? Possibly. Possibly. More like a weighs a lot in your stomach. Yeah, yeah. It just makes you feel full. So heavy food, I guess, meat could be considered heavy, heavy carbs, pancakes. Although pancakes are a tricky one because when I eat pancakes, I always regret it. I love them. They taste great, especially good chocolate chip pancake. But they are, it's like empty carbs for me.

0:02:43
So an hour or two later, I've eaten a lot. But I haven't gotten any good nutrition. Yeah, I hate that. When you eat a lot and then an hour later, you're hungry again and you're like, what did I just do? Like, right. You know, these calories are kind of empty calories in a way. Yeah, yeah. So heavy foods. Yeah, sometimes, guys, if you're, you know, maybe with a friend, you're deciding what to eat. Like, you might hear somebody say something like, oh, I don't want anything heavy. Like, let's just like get a salad. You know, like, you don't want like something that's really going to weigh down your stomach. Maybe you're just getting a snack or something like that.

0:03:15
Exactly. And you can see this around the world, guys, and we know that, or at least I think that in, for example, northern Italy, the food is a little heavier than in southern Italy, right? More butter, that kind of thing. Or in the US, you know, in the summer versus the winter, you don't want, you don't want a super heavy meal with potatoes and heavy stuff and meat in the summer. Maybe you want something lighter, right? Yeah. Yeah. So, and the next word is staple. So not like a staple in a paper, guys, we use a staple to talk about a food or something that's traditional or typical and a fundamental part of the diet, for example. So like, you could say like coffee is a staple of American breakfast. Yeah.

0:04:03
I mean, I think when you're talking to a nae speaker, it's fun to use this in your own way. So you take this word and you say, this is one of my staples or it's my staple, coffee is my staple, you're kind of making a joke, right? It's not. I guess it is kind of, but I mean, I guess typical staples, if you look at nutrition, would be things like rice, pasta, the baseline stuff. Like I would have to guess that in Japan where I live there and I know people ate rice bowls for breakfast even, a staple would be rice, right? That feels right. And maybe in the US it's bread. Do you eat a lot of bread, Michelle? I do. Yeah, me too, me too. I mean, I know, you know, healthy and not healthy, but it's kind of hard to get away from eating bread for me.

0:04:48
It is, for sure, for sure. So that's good. It's, well, I mean, because sandwiches are so big in American culture. Yeah. And I love them too. Yeah. That's what it's for you. Yeah. It's the next term that you guys heard yesterday and that you want to use when you talk about coffee with native speakers, you know, how do you take your coffee, right? That is the, that's what anyone's going to ask you in conversation or how would you like your coffee, right, Michelle? And how, and I take my coffee black. That means I don't add anything to my coffee. I don't add sugar.

0:05:19
I don't add cream. So that's a really common way to talk about taking coffee, taking it black, right? Right, right, right. Just with nothing added.

One time enrollment required. Benefit ends 31st of December, 2024. Exclusions, decency supply. Yes. And then the last one is carbs, which is short for carbohydrates, right? So this is like your bread, flour, potatoes, those kinds of things. Serial, right? Yeah, exactly. And you know, I feel like right now we're kind of at a war on carbs, right? But you know, I just, we have so many different kinds of diets in the US. That's something that's interesting about our culture. We have so many, to be honest, overweight people, but we have so many, we're so obsessed with nutrition at the same time. Right. So that's interesting here.

0:06:32
What what gets right? I'm not sure. I remember in the 90s, it was all about like no fat, low fat or no fat, like fat free, fat free. That was the thing, right? But now it's like good fat, bad fat. Oh, gosh. Yeah, it really changed a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot. Yeah, but you guys need to be ready to talk about these things. It's very likely that you'll strike up a conversation in natural English with the native speaker about diet. So use some of these terms, right Michelle? Right, right, right, exactly. No, these are really good. So yeah, we did heavy food, staple black coffee and carbs or carbohydrates.

0:07:10
Good stuff. Yeah, exactly. Write those down guys and take them into your next conversation and make sure you hit follow because in the next episode, we're going to talk about what to do when you just can't learn anymore. So come back, hit, you know, go and listen to that one to find out exactly what that means. I can't wait to get to that one, Michelle. You ready? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's going to be fun. Oh, my gosh. Lindsay, well, enjoy your next breakfast. I will. You know, this is my favorite meal of the day. So I would. Yeah, well, it's a good one.

0:07:39
