Welcome to the all-ears English podcast where you'll finally get real native English conversation and fluency for business and life. We believe in connection, not perfection when it comes to learning English. Now here are your hosts Lindsay McMan, the English adventurer and Michelle Kaplan, the New York radio girl coming to you from Boston and New York City, USA. In today's episode learn three key terms that you can use when you talk about scooting and biking and transportation with a native speaker. 

Hey Lindsay, how are you? Hey, I'm Michelle. What's going on in your world. Oh, not too much, not too much. Yeah, I am thinking still about transportation. Yesterday we had a really interesting conversation about transportation in the US and how things are changing in cities and so guys, we are going to continue talking about the topic, give you a little bit of vocab today.

0:01:54
We want to remind you though before we get started to follow the All Iters English podcast so you don't miss any of our episodes. We are here four times a week talking about connection, not perfection. Yes, how to use English and forget about being perfect. Forget about your grammar mistakes. When you learn with us guys, we are focusing on showing you how to connect in English. In business, in your life, in school, whatever it is, we'll show you how to connect. And today's topic again, like Michelle said, we're talking again about transportation, but we're going to give you some key vocabulary terms to actually have a conversation with a native speaker about this topic. Right, because now we want to extend it into that idea. Right, right, right, exactly Lindsay. So, yeah, let's get to it. Yes, so yesterday or in the last episode, episode 18, go back and listen if you haven't, but in episode 18, we did talk about how in more cities, we can now rent scooters, bikes, to get around the city. We just have to scan the code, pay for it, and then drop it off when we arrive at our destination. I love this. And Michelle, I've been using scooters. I was in Nashville a while ago, just celebrating a birthday and we scooted all over the city of Nashville. So, I just dropped a verb, a little verb for our listeners. What's the verb I just dropped?

0:03:12
You said, it's a scoot. We scooted. Yeah, that's to use a scooter, guys. You're on with the one foot and you're moving with the other foot. Hang it on. And yeah, that's a scooter. So, to scoot is to use the scooter. No, actually, Michelle, these are next-level scooters. If you haven't seen them, they're motor powered. So, we're not using any muscles. We're not kicking off with our foot like a kid would. Oh, right. Oh my gosh. Now, well, I haven't used any of those. Oh, yeah. They are fun. They go up to about 14 miles an hour. And they're computerized, so it knows where you are. So, if there's some sidewalk that's not allowed on the map, it actually will ding or... We tried taking them over a bridge in Nashville, and our scooters were constantly like ringing a bell. It was very embarrassing. Because people looked at us like we were stealing the scooters. We weren't. But we weren't supposed to take them over that particular bridge. So, they're very web-2.0, Michelle. Oh, oh my gosh. Awesome. So, is it easy to just kind of grab a scooter?

0:04:15
And what does that mean to grab a scooter? Yeah. And grab a bike. Good question. And that's our next Vokab term, guys. I hope you're writing these down. Make sure you write them down to get ready for this conversation with the native. But yeah, it really is. So, I can open my app and I can see, oh, okay, here's a scooter at this intersection. I can reserve it in advance, so it'll wait for me up to about 10 to 15 minutes, not a day or two, right? And then I go and I check out. I just scan it. I check out. And then it records how much you owe by the time, and then it just... It builds your Apple Pay. Oh, okay. Okay. Well, that's really convenient. So, grab a scooter, grab a bike. It means to take it. To get one.

0:04:55
Exactly. Exactly. I love that. So, guys, it was so far. Your vocabulary words for today are to scoot. Right? That's a verb. So, we go ahead and we say, we scoot it or we'll scoot there. Right? And grab a scooter or grab a bike. And we're talking about the bike shares, right? Where it's not... Where you're going, you're getting one from this app. Now, Michelle, what's the next term that our listeners need to know? All right. This one I love. It's like riding a bike. All right. What are we talking about here? Well, it's funny because we're not necessarily talking about riding the bike. So, with the bike, the idea is that you don't forget how to ride a bike. Because it's always in your muscle memory.

0:05:35
It's like one of those things. You just... You can't really forget it. Although, it's not true in my situation. You forgot how to ride a bike. I mean, I didn't forget it. I wasn't ever a great bike rider. That was to begin with. Let's start with that. But like, when I did try again, I fell off and it was a little bit of a bloody mess. And that's why... Oh, I should wait. Wait. Wait. Tell us this story, Michelle. When did this happen? Okay. So, it happened... How did it happen like 13 or 14 years ago? Okay. Good. And we were... I was on a trip and it was like a group of us.

0:06:08
And I wanted to do biking. And you could either go biking or you could go shopping. And it was like a nice trip. And I was like, oh, well, I'll try biking. And everyone talked about how terrible they were going to be a biking. Oh, they hadn't written it in such a long time. And I said, no, I'm going to be terrible. They said, no, I'm going to be terrible. I said, I'm going to be terrible. And they all got on and they started. And then I fell off right away. Before this starting line. And yeah, my hands are all bloody. And I had to ride in the van with someone. Oh, no, Michelle.

0:06:38
Yeah. What kind of bike was it? Was it like a street bike or a mountain bike? It was a race. I was a racing bike. I was a racing bike. Okay. A regular bike. And so, that kind of gave me a mental block on it. But, you know, I will try again. But so, but generally, when you say it's like riding a bike, it's supposed to be like, oh, it's something that's easy. It kind of comes back to you. You just get it.

0:07:00
Yeah. Completely. So guys, this can be used. Obviously, outside of a conversation about bikes, you can use this with anything. If you, you know, maybe someone has played a card game their whole lives. Usually this is about muscle memory, though. Right, Michelle? This is about some kind of action that you will never forget because you learned it young. Like, being right. Right, right, right. Exactly. That's a good point. Usually, learn it young.

0:07:24
So, it's like, oh, it'll come back to you. Even if you don't really remember it right now, like, it's going to come back to you right when you'd start to try again. Like, I don't think I could forget how to hit a tennis ball. I have hit at the tennis ball so many times in my life when I was a kid. I would spend hours, summer afternoons against the backboard. Just boom, boom, hitting the ball all day. I loved it so much. So, I could never forget how to hit that ball. Right, there you go. There you go. Like, even if you didn't hit a ball for years and years, like, yeah, maybe for the first minute, it would feel a little bit funny, but then you would get right back into it.

0:07:58
Like, once your muscles would kind of take over. And there's something really cool. I think as humans, we love mastery. Like, we love being able to do something well. It's part of being human and feeling good about ourselves in the world. So, make sure you find that thing that to you guys is like riding a bike. Maybe we can talk about that in another episode. How to find that thing, that activity, that physical activity that we know is like riding a bike to us. Have a show? Exactly. Exactly.

0:08:22
Oh my gosh. Cool. This was a lot of fun guys today. It's got some really great vocab. And, yeah, some stories from us. Absolutely. This has been fantastic. Guys, use these terms when you have a conversation about biking or just about life and activities with a native speaker. And Michelle, thanks for listening us today.
