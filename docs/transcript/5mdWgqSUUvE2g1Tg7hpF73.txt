I'm having a fabulous day as well and listeners, we hope you are too. You are in for a treat today. This is so cool because the last time Aubrey and I were here together, we talked about English from Trinidad and you got to hear that really awesome accent. You are going to learn some real New York City vocabulary. We talked to Michael from Happy English and he taught us how to sound like a New Yorker. I don't think I can sound like a New Yorker but he tried to teach us. So guys, we're going to share some of that interview with you.

0:02:13
This is going to be really fun. I lived in New York for a little while and I remember all the time just sort of being stopped in my tracks by. It's the fun words they would say. I loved the accent every now and then especially if I was in Brooklyn, I feel like we would like I'd buy pizza somewhere. Or I remember getting a lobster roll and they may like, here's a lobster roll. It's so cute and it sounds so different to me. Maybe you guys listening don't hear it quite as much, they'll drop their Rs. The vowels sound different and it's really fun for us to hear this accent. It's like it's like punchier. It sounds more aggressive to me. It's just like stronger for somehow, you know. Guys, listeners, I'm sure that you have heard this accent before. There are countless movies and TV shows set in New York, right? There are so many times when you might have heard this accent. So when you hear Michael teach us these phrases today guys, I think you'll recognize some of what he's saying.

0:03:17
When I think of the New York accent, I always think of that old Saturn and I live sketch with Mike Myers when he was a coffee talk. Do you remember that? Was it being Joan Rivers or something like that or sort of impersonating her? Kind of. That's a great example. Yeah, I bet he wasn't impersonating her. Anyway guys, look up coffee talk SNL on YouTube if you want to see it. There's so many of those sketches. Anyway, let's get to Michael from Happy English though. So he's going to give us a great example of this accent. Actually, in New York it's coffee and I thought I could show your listeners a usual sentence that we would say here in New York, which would be this. I'm going to walk my dog to the corner and grab a coffee for a quarter. This is so fun. I loved hearing New Yorkers say coffee like that. So great.

0:04:16
I feel like it's similar in Boston to right or somewhere else but yeah, a lot in the East. Well, to us, we're both West Coast ladies. I think if I'm hearing a New Yorker next to someone from Boston, I might be able to tell them apart but I can't be 100% sure. But they are different accents though. Yes, exactly. A New Yorker will recognize a Bostonian any day. But for those of us who aren't as familiar, they sound pretty similar. Yeah, exactly. I love it so much. Any of the movies that in Boston are also so fun to listen to those accents, even going back to like Goodwill Hunting. Such a good movie. Okay, so let's get into this vocabulary, guys. We're going to learn some words that you will hear on the streets of New York. You guys might be going there to study maybe or maybe just for vacation. The first word is Agida. Agida. Now, I had never heard this word.

0:05:23
Aubrey, have you heard this word before? No, I haven't either. I feel like I lived there a couple of years but I don't remember ever hearing that. This is super local. Okay, let's hear Michael teach us this word. So Agida has kind of two meanings. The first one is it's a heart bird. It's a way we turn that heart bird from eating something. It's a spicy food or some pizza you can say, wow, that pizza gave me Agida. Okay, so heart bird. Apparently it can be used like that. But he later told us that Agida can also describe something super stressful. Like, if the train is late, you could be like, the train's given me Agida. Like, the train is stressing me out. Do we have an equivalent for that that might be more common for our students? Maybe I was going to say the Hebe Gebes, but that's more like scared.

0:06:21
Yeah, yeah, for stress. Maybe you wiggin me out. No, that's more scared too. I don't know. I would just say like, gave me a headache. I mean, honestly, there isn't one idiom that we would say all the time. We would just say it's super stressful, right? Or it's giving me a headache. Or it's the bane of my existence. If it's something that like you really don't like. So there are other phrases, but I mean, honestly, we just say it's super stressful most of the time. Okay, now the next one is super famous. This is like the classic thing that you hear at all the mob movies from Godfather to good fellows to casino one of my favorite movies. Okay, I'm going to ask you how do you say this? Forget about it. Oh my god, that was great.

0:07:12
Oh, no, bad. That was so good. So it's just forget about it. But again, like all these words are put together. And Michael says it means no way. Which I like. Like, I like hearing that direct translation. Because I don't think I was super clear before what it was meant to say. So what's an example of how New Yorker might use this? Yeah, so if someone asks you, oh, you want to eat pizza here? And they'd be like, forget about it. You want me to walk all the way over there? Forget about it. No way. It's so good. So it just means no way.

0:07:49
Like, no way. I love it. So let's go to the real New Yorker, Michael, and hear the next phrase for how he would give his opinion. And that's not an easy phrase that we use when you want to give your opinion about something that you believe is true. And maybe the listener doesn't know or doesn't realize it. And it's usually followed by butt. For example, not for nothing, but you guys have the best English podcast. Cool. Now, Aubrey, you lived there. Have you heard people use that phrase? I don't feel like I heard that one either. I think it's interesting how seldom you actually chat with a local New Yorker when you live there, right? I was teaching. I was in the Bronx. My students didn't use these phrases.

0:08:42
They were from the Dominican Republic in Cuba and Puerto Rico. So they were, it's like, you have to be like third generation New Yorker to be using these. So I've definitely heard not for nothing on TV and in movies. But I don't remember hearing anyone say that one. Say with me, I've only heard it on TV and in the movies. You know, they just came out recently with a new sopranos movie. I think that was one of the first amazing prestige television shows guys. And I think you'll definitely hear all of these phrases in that show. Super famous. Okay, now this is the next one guys. Scooch. Now to me, if I say scooch, it means like move over. Like scooch over just a little bit. Like move over. So I have room to sit down.

0:09:34
But that's not how Michael uses it. What do you think that means? Oh man, I have no idea. I use it the same instead of scooch over. We'll say scooch over. Right. Yeah. Yeah, scooch. I'm going to take a shot in the dark and say this is when someone is carrying their dog around in a purse. And they call the purse a scooch. Oh my god. I wish. Let's just say that's it. Let's just decide. No, guys.

0:10:00
We need a word for that. I know we do, right? That's my favorite guess though of yours. So Michael told us that it actually he uses it to describe something or someone that's annoying or bothersome. It's a very interesting. So let's hear Michael use it in a sentence. Sometimes sometimes my dog uses scooch when I'm trying to work. She always comes here and she wants to play with me. I stay happy. Stop being a scooch. Oh my gosh, that's so cute. Now we've already told you, Aubrey and I don't use scooch like that, right? We use it as a scooch or like move a little bit. What would we say in this case though? Yeah, maybe a nuisance or a past.

0:10:44
I do love that. Just at least Scott that he you know he talked about a dog. So I feel like I was in the general vicinity. I know that's awesome. I was surprised when you said that because I knew what he was going to say. So that part was me was really impressive. Alright, so get guys, Michael says that all of these phrases are super common in New York City. He said it's actually every day English. They're in the big apple. So these are phrases that he uses all the time because he grew up there and he still lives here. And what's really cool about all these phrases is guys you'll never get these words in a textbook, right? But you'll hear them on the streets of New York. So Aubrey, I think we should try and do a role play right now using his New York words. What do you think? Yes, and we'll try to sound like real New Yorkers you guys.

0:11:33
And then if we don't, you can just laugh at us when you watch one of these movies, watch Goodfellas or something and compare our accent to theirs. I'll tell you right now my accent will be terrible. But I just so you know. Alright, here we go. Hey, I haven't been to this neighborhood before and I'm starving. Where's good to eat around here? Not for nothing, but the pizza place right around the street has the best pie in the city. Forget about it. No way. It's not better than pasties pizza in my neighborhood. Patsies pizza in my neighborhood. Forget about it. I've been there. Give me Agita.

0:12:15
Don't be a scooch. That can't be true. Just come on. Let me buy you a slice and you can see for yourself. If you have a little Joe Ripper, then speak for yourself. Okay, that was awesome. I did not try to have an accent at all except for the New York word. So, I'll be fantastic. Aubrey. So guys, Michael is still churning out amazing content for you guys all the time.
