Oh my gosh I'm so excited to be back here on this second episode of all ears English. I can't wait Lucky number two lucky number two and I want to remind our listeners guys this Paul all-ears English podcast Publishes four times a week. We give you guys these amazing episodes four days a week So make sure you follow our podcast wherever you listen to podcasts Michelle, what are we talking about today? Okay. Well today we're talking about something that is super super important right this is about Interviewing right interviewing in the US Guys if you do have a job interview coming up or you know that in the future you will want to interview You want to be prepared with interview questions? So we're gonna talk about common ones today Yeah interview questions and also just kind of some key we're gonna start with two key Yeah, there's more key vocabulary words that we have to know Michelle I mean imagine if you walk into an interview and someone asks you to fill out a form and you don't know what that means You're dead right from the start right Exactly. Yeah, so to fill out this is very important. So yeah, this basically means to complete the application right?

0:02:12So like for example, you could say please fill out this application if you're interested in the job Exactly exactly Michelle. Do you tend to get nervous when you have in-person interviews? I find I'm though like one person who finds them like kind of fun You said that one's about public speaking too. Yeah, I don't know. It's just I I It's kind of I don't know I guess I look at it and not that it's a game or anything, but in a way it is It's like you know, you're kind of putting on a show. It's like I don't know It's a little bit theatrical it's your it's your time to really show who you are. Yeah, so I feel like if people try and look at it in that sense Rather than oh my god. Oh my god, right, but I think it more as like a game or like oh what like what can I say like what are What are some of the things that I want to talk about? I don't know I feel like you can kind of approach it in a different way. Yeah, that is such good advice. Oh make it a game Right make it a game and make sure you go in having the words that you need that is so good Michelle interesting So yeah, I think that's a unique perspective. I think a lot of our listeners might get kind of nervous But we want to empower you guys go in make it a game enjoy yourself and just build that relationship right Michelle Exactly exactly. So the key is to just you know feel comfortable So that's our next phrase right to say something is the key. Yes Um, what does that mean Lindsay? Well, I mean literally the way that a key unlocks the door right yeah So let's say for example education is the key to freedom and if I'm describing if I'm sitting in this interview and I'm Describing my work experience right I could say you know my master's degree was the key to my success in this area So you guys right articulate this word in a lot of ways to show how valuable you are to that employer right right right right That's so true. That's so true. Yeah, very good useful expression here So yeah, Lindsay let's get into a couple questions today This is this way, you know, we all want to be prepared know some of the common ones. Let's see what's the first one Oh my gosh, this one is so common guys at least in American culture American business culture Interviewing you are gonna hear this. It's just so common. So here it is The phrase is tell us about yourself or tell me about tell me about yourself right tell me about yourself now Michelle How do you suggest high-level advice for our listeners? How should we approach this question?

0:04:41Well Like I said make it a game. No, I don't know. He doesn't need to do that. But I mean I Personally what I've heard about this question is that you don't want to just simply recite your resume That's like one of the things that I've heard the most is you know They you got an interview because you submitted your resume So you want to show a little bit of personality You don't want to just like sound monotonous and just kind of like give like a repeated version of your resume You want to kind of basically tell the story of what you brought you to this place today Yeah, I love that Michelle It's so true because if I'm interviewing someone I can look at your resume I can read your cover letter I have all that information. This is kind of more of an elevator pitch and maybe Michelle and in the other episode We could actually do that would be a cool episode we could do an episode on the elevator pitch Elevator pitch yes, you know for entrepreneurs, but also for Individual job applicants right we all need an elevator pitch to say who we are Why we add value and how we can help the company right? That's how I would structure my answer to this question So we're gonna follow up in another episode Make sure you guys follow all our English podcast so you can get that episode another day Michelle Let's finish with one more question. Okay, the next one is what do you do and guys again?

0:05:59It's not what do you do, but you'll hear it pronounced what do you do? That's kind of how you might hear it and and this means what do you do for work right? So this good guys this isn't necessarily on a job interview This might be and this is also super important for networking meeting people On the casual conversations. Yeah, you might ask someone what do you do? So it's great to meet you. What do you do? What do you do and we want to emphasize how these words guys on this podcast We talk a lot about pronunciation these words run together like Michelle said right not what do you do? What do you do?
