Make sure that you follow us and so that you never miss any of our episodes four days a week. Exactly, especially if you have the right mindset for an all ears English listener and that mindset is connection not perfection. That's right. That means that when we learn English together as a community, we believe that human connection is the reason we're learning English. We are not learning to memorize grammar, we are not learning to be perfect, we're learning to build a human connection with you and another person, okay? Whether you're at work or at a party or at school. So go ahead and hit follow, we publish four days a week, okay guys? So lots of all ears English to enjoy and we're here for you. We really do. We do and it's and you know and on in that same way, you know, a lot of learners and listeners, Michelle, our audience members, they worry a lot about making mistakes, right? So what can we do to help them? I mean, today's episode is all about making sure we change our mindset about making mistakes. Right, right, right. Exactly. We want to, you know, feel more confident, feel more comfortable in ourselves. So should we share a quote today? Yeah, let's start off with a nice quote, a motivating quote. And then hopefully this will start to shift the way you guys think about what you're doing here. So what is that quote, Michelle? Okay, it's by William the W. Perky. On the quote is, you've got to dance like there's nobody watching love like you'll never be hurt, sing like there's nobody singing and live like it's heaven on earth.

It sounds like a song. Maybe it is a song. I don't know. Maybe it is. Maybe it is. What comes to mind when you hear this quote, Michelle? Well, I don't know. It just the idea of doing things fully, right? Really just being present with your full self. I mean, I'm trying to think of how that might relate to, you know, my life. But I guess, I guess I think of, I guess I think of traveling and like just like doing things that I love, like going traveling and that those times when I've pushed myself to do something outside of my comfort zone and it's always been worth it. So like going into things like with an open mind, open heart, things like that. I mean, Lindsay, does this relate to you in any way? Yeah. For sure. I think definitely moments when, for example, when I was in my 20s, I traveled through South America. I think it gets, I think the key in life is making sure we take that same attitude when we're young of just going into situations, not worrying about what is happening, living wholeheartedly as we get older. We want to make sure we keep doing that, right? Because in my 20s, I back back through South America. My goal was to learn Spanish in that year. I lived with a family in Guatemala. I lived in an apartment in Argentina. I mean, I really, really went deep into the culture. I was in a lot of moments where I looked silly, like I looked like the one that just had no one's going on. That's because I was just learning Spanish and I didn't care. I was still building connections. That's what it comes down to.

0:04:59
Right, right, right, exactly. I mean, that's a perfect example of a, you know, something that I think our listeners should keep in mind. I mean, it's very specific. Lindsay, so I think it's just this quote in general, guys, you know, just you put yourself into it. Whatever you do, right? So when it's learning your language, don't be afraid. Just look at it as kind of like a growing experience and everybody when they're learning something new can be uncomfortable or it's a little bit scary, but language learning is definitely a, you know, a very specific one that can make you feel that way. But it keeps this quote in mind and yeah, go for it. Yeah, and I also want to say that when I think of this quote, I actually think a little bit of kind of mindfulness because what this quote is asking us to do is be present in the moment.

0:06:15
And let's go back to my example in South America. There was a moment when I was sitting on a beach in Columbia with a group of native Spanish speakers, one person from Spain and then everyone else was from Columbia. And I was in a circle and I was embarrassed and being hard at myself because I couldn't understand what they were saying. They were actually talking about American politics. And I was feeling ashamed because I couldn't understand it. But at some point, I just said, forget it. I don't care. I'm going to, I'm going to connect with these guys as I can. But there's other things going on in that moment that I could have missed, but I didn't miss. For example, the smell of the ocean sitting on the beach, the feeling of the sand on my hands, the smiles of the people, the local people, what I was drinking, what I was eating, those are sensory experiences that I could totally miss if I spent all my time up in my head. I'll never get that moment back. I'll never go back to that beach in that moment in Columbia, right? But I have that moment in my heart because I didn't lose it. I didn't lose myself in my mind. That was beautifully said, Lindsay. I loved that. Thank you for sharing that. I mean, guys, you have so much to listen to learn here from this discussion from Lindsay's experience. So, really take this to heart. Think about how it applies to your life and move forward. And yeah, guys, remember that we are here four days a week.
