0:00:51Use the news and TV sitcoms to start English conversations. Today, get the best sitcoms and news shows. And find out exactly how to use this strategy to connect. Hello, Lindsay, how are you? Hey, Michelle. Happy to be on the microphone with you for our listeners. Today, I'm doing great. I'm going to do a great, how was your weekend? Oh, it was nice. It was nice. I got to be outside a little bit, so that was good. How about you? Wonderful. Yeah, I hiked a crazy high mountain over the weekend. And I've always outdoed mainland. No, but actually I have a story, real quick, real quick story.

0:01:28We actually found a stray dog over the weekend. Yeah, it was really dramatic. So he followed us. We were scooting around Denver and we found him on the lawn and he tried falling us. He almost followed us into the street. Oh, we tried to find his owner. Couldn't find his owner. Took him to the vet, scanned his chip because dogs now have a chip, which links them back to the owner, right? Uh-huh. Scandace chip couldn't, no, he wasn't registered. Oh, wow.

0:01:54So we took him to our house, but he didn't get along with our dog. So we had to take him to the shelter. But luckily, we were posting on next door, which is like our neighborhood forum. And we got connected with the owner. So the owner of the next morning could go and pick the dog up. Oh, good. Oh, wow. That's, that's quite a story. It was quite a day. I mean, between hiking a 14,000 foot mountain and then, you know, finding a dog, it was a big day. So I'm just going to hike to 18,000 foot mountain. Hey, 18,000. That's almost like every rister. Yeah, I, yeah, Lindsay. I, I'm just going to start making up stuff so I can compute.

0:02:30Oh, so okay. Well, wow. Okay. Well, that dog was lucky to find you. So, yeah. But anyways, we're not talking about dogs or hiking today. Oh, wow. We're talking about TV. TV, which offers a whole range of other adventures, right, Michelle? Oh, exactly. I mean, Lindsay, I, I think that a lot of, a lot of people when they're learning a new language, they kind of turn to the TV. And I want to talk about this today. Like, is it a good idea? Like, what's, what are some of the benefits with learning English using the TV? I don't know. What do you think? Well, you know, Michelle, I think when it comes down to, and we, we do a lot of IELTS, you know, if you guys go find the IELTS Energy podcast, we do a lot of IELTS preparation as well. We find that when students have a lot of material in their mind, they have stories, they have jokes, they have current events, they have sitcoms that they've seen funny situations, they have a lot to say and they become more confident. Have you seen that, Michelle, with your students?

0:03:28Yes. I, I think so because I'm, you just want to constantly be building up like your bank of material to be able to talk to people about something. So like, for example, I always, whenever, like, I've had it where I've come into a classroom, oh, what did you do over the weekend? Oh, nothing. Really? You did nothing? Oh, I just stayed inside. I just, you did nothing inside. Oh, I watched TV. Oh, and I kind of like a lot of people spend their weekends that way and that's fine. So maybe, instead of saying nothing, you want to always try and actually put something forward. Maybe that person watches a TV show. Wow, I spent the whole weekend watching friends. I spent the whole week, you know, and that's fine. So like, it just gives you more things to talk about. It gives you more things to learn because there are tons of references in TV shows. So it's all good. Exactly, Michelle. And you know, on this show again, what we believe in is connection, not perfection.

0:04:21And nothing kills connection faster than when someone inquires about your weekend and you said you did nothing. Right. Right. It just does the connection right away. Yeah, you got to say something. Yeah, makes it, makes it seem like you're close off like you don't want to connect. But we know you guys want to connect. Okay. So we're going to start today by throwing out some news channels where you can get the news. There's a lot going on in the news right now. And we want you guys to be informed so that this material will help you start conversations. And then we'll give you some TV sitcoms that you should be watching. Okay. Love it. Love it. Well, some places start. So there's the BBC. NPR is another good one. And NPR also has a lot of, I know they have transcripts. Well, this is, this is for listening, right? Yeah. I mean, so you could, I guess, well, NPR is more of a listening channel. It's a national public radio. But they have a lot of shows. If you just go to their website guys and they do have transcripts, I think. BBC is going to give you that more British perspective, right? And which I think probably tends to be more international as well, compared to an American NPR is my guess. And then, you know, Hulu is what is Hulu? Do you use Hulu?

0:05:33I don't have Hulu. I have Hulu. Yeah. Yeah. But I do, you know, a lot of ABC, NBC, those are like your regular ones. Maybe the CBS. Then there's, you know, the cable networks. The cable networks, right? There's always CNN, right? That's a big one that's always on TV. So lots of places to get your news. The point is it doesn't matter where you go, just get the news. Or I make sure you're getting the news. And then also, so that's 50% of your media diet. And then the other 50% is, of course, TV shows. And lately, I've been going back through the old episodes of Sex in the City. Michelle. That's a nice. The classic Sex in the City. Sarah, Michelle, was Sarah Jessica Parker. It's just a fun show. It's about New York. I love New York. So it's just, it's fun. It's fun. Yeah, they're rebooting it, I think. I heard that. That's so exciting. Yeah. That's exciting. Or guys, you can check out Seinfeld, which is one of my favorite ones. I mean, it's old now, but it's so funny. And then friends, of course, there's also Modern Family is a really, really good one to learn with. I love that. It's so good. Modern Family. Law in order. If you like crime shows, very common. Grace Anatomy has over the years been really common. Another good example of good writing is Orange is the New Black. It's older now, but it's, it's just good writing.

0:06:59It's really good. And Michelle, the root. Yeah, go ahead. Sorry. And a drama. Another drama is this is us. Oh my gosh. Yes. Michelle, I have mixed feelings about that show because to be honest, it's very human. It's very relatable. But every time I watch it, I feel like intensely sad. Yeah. It is a sad show. I know you can't go into it without expecting you might, he might shed a tear or two, but it's kind of, yeah. I know. It's not my number one, but I do like it. It depends on your mood. So we've given our listener something for everyone. Guys, if you're in a crime shows, go for Law in order. If you're in a medical shows, Grace Anatomy, I also like the good doctor. We've been watching that. The good doctor. It's a good one. So guys, lots of options. The point is make sure you get your media diet because we need material. Michelle, in sign fell, there's a ton of scenarios that people are constantly native speakers are constantly referring to. So you want to be able to participate in those conversations, right, Michelle?
