Hey, Michelle, I have a question for you. Ooh, I'm excited to hear it. What is it? Okay, here it is.

0:01:35
Do you feel like you are good at staying in the present? I feel like I am awful at. Oh, no, oh, no. Tell us what's going on. Tell us why. I don't know. I tend to think about all the things for the future. Sometimes I'm living years into the future. And considering what may or may not happen, it is so bad. And I've talked with friends about this. I've just been like, I don't want to not enjoy the moments that I'm living with, especially now I'm a mom. Like, I have a little one. I don't want to miss out on these precious moments.

0:02:10
Oh, gosh. So I need to get better at just staying present, staying in the moment. I don't know. What about you Lindsay? Or do you have any advice? Well, I mean, have you tried anything to get present? Have you tried any kind of meditation? Is there anything? Yeah. A little bit, a little bit. I've tried also in the moment being like, oh, I want to recognize that this is like a nice. Yeah. That I'm living in, you know?

0:02:31
Uh-huh. For sure. Yeah, I mean, just snapping out of it. I wish I could like snap a rubber band on my wrist and be like, be present, be present. But yeah, no, I don't think I'm very good at it, but I've tried to learn how to do it over the years. I think I'm probably average. I'm not the worst, but I'm definitely not the best. I know people that are a lot more present than me. And it just baffles me, by the way, good vocab word for listeners. It baffles me. What does that mean? It's basically like it confuses me.

0:02:59
Like, I don't know the answer. Like, yeah, when I see people that are just that present, I think, well, are they not worried about what's happening next? Or they not, like, how does that brain work? Right, right, right. But why are we talking about this on this podcast for our listeners? For learning as well? This is important for learning as well, because when you learn, I mean, sometimes it's, I think it's very easy to keep the goals in mind, and you should always keep the goals in mind. Like, why are you learning and everything? But I wouldn't always think about just like the future or the past, right?

0:03:33
Like, oh, take you made that experience that you had. Like, try and live in this moment. Whatever happened is in the past and whatever is is in the future. And try and take some time. I can understand like with the future, especially thinking about like, oh, like, why am I learning? Keeping that in mind. But don't let it take away from what's happening in this moment. So we wanted to share this quote, right, Lindsay? Yeah, so I'm going to read the quote here. And then we'll talk a little bit more about it. So here we go, guys, your future is created by what you do today and not tomorrow.

0:04:04
I mean, that's very straightforward. I would also think about this in a microcosm of just one conversation. Your brain literally does not have enough space to have a conversation, be engaging, ask questions, be interesting, and think three steps ahead to what happens if someone asks me a question that I don't understand or what happens if this, that, how's the conversation going to end? You can't do it, guys, so don't try. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I just think that keeping this quote in mind can make learning English more fun, more joyful, right? Just like staying in that moment and enjoying the connections and what you're doing with people in that current moment and what you're learning at that time.

0:04:44
And just like kind of staying your head that way and not get too flighty or out there. Exactly, don't get too flighty. So be present, guys. That is our message for today. Be rooted in yourself, know that you are strong enough to make that connection with English speakers. They want to talk to you and don't think three steps ahead if you're a chess player. That's great, but this is not right. We're not playing chess here. We're communicating and we're connecting. And there's a couple of website suggestions that we have, right, Michelle, for our listeners to get tuned into this way of living.

0:05:15
Yeah, there's one tiny Buddha. Mm-hmm, tiny Buddha.com. Yep, there's also Zen Habits, which is a common mindfulness blog by Leo Balbauta. And then I read the book. This book got me really into meditation back in, like 2009, The Power of Now by Eckhart Toley. And I'm sure our listeners know about this. It's been translated all over the world. But if you don't know about it, guys, it's a good gateway into meditation and mindfulness. Mm-hmm. Oh, all right. Sounds good. I'll have to check it out.

0:05:45
Mm-hmm, good stuff. Good luck, everyone. Yeah, I mean, in the end, the takeaway, guys, today is stay rooted in you. You have a lot to offer, so connect. Don't think four or five steps ahead, like a chess player. All right. All right, very good. Guys, remember to follow all ears English wherever you listen to podcasts. Don't miss us. We're on four days a week. And we're here to help you get to empowered for your career English and for your life. Awesome.

0:06:10
I love it. Lindsay, this was fun. All right, take care, bye. Bye.
