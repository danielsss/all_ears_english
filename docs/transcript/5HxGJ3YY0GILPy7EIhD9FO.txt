I know, I'm happy to be here. What are we talking about in today's episode, Aubrey?

0:01:40So this is really vital we're talking about when is the best time to start studying English. And here's the thing we're going to share a quote today because, okay, Lindsay, share for us. All right, let's just dive right into the quote. Here it is, don't wait. The time will never be just right. And that is, we don't know who said that, someone said it. But yeah, I mean, that quote just gets right to the heart of the matter today, doesn't it? Exactly, right? That's really it. The time is never perfect for learning a language because other things are going to come up. Priorities needs, there are going to be things, there's lots of issues that can get in the way. So if you're putting it off until it's the perfect time to have the, you know, amount of time and nothing else in the way that's never going to happen, never. Exactly. And I'm glad we're talking about this now because this episode is coming out at the end of December, which means we all have an opportunity. Right, I love sitting down in the week before Christmas and New Year's and writing out my goals for the New Year. Do you do that, Aubrey? Do you? And not so much for resolutions, but do you have a vision for your year? Definitely. And this is very appropriate because they do almost always include a goal for learning language. Because my problem is I'll start. I'm like, okay, I'm not delaying it. But then it'll last a few days. And then I'll get busy. I won't keep prioritizing it.

0:03:01So that's the thing. Like, don't wait. But also like once you dive in, keep it up. Do what it takes, set alarms, you know, put in your calendar specific times to study so that you can keep it up and get in that habit. Exactly. And there are certain ways that we can, we understand that as we take action, we get confidence. There's confidence and momentum. Momentum is huge. Aubrey, we should do another episode on momentum. Yeah. Because when we have momentum, it results from just taking small actions towards the goal. We then feel excited about what we're working for. So if I'm like January 1, I wake up and I say, I'm going to become fluent in Spanish this year. That's a big goal. And we might procrastinate. But what could we do? How can we break down that goal where the first week of January, we could do something that would be actionable, right? It's the actionable. Like I am going to sign up for a class online. And it doesn't even have to be like a Spanish learning class. It could be like a class for learning cooking that you're going to take in Spanish. Something that you're interested in to keep yourself engaged and motivated. And once you've invested the money to pay for that, you're going to go because you've paid for it. You're going to prioritize it. It's so fun taking cooking classes. And when we were in Peru, you know, that Lima has a big food culture, right? Really good food down there. And we took a cooking class in Spanish, in Lima. It was so much fun. It was so much fun. Yeah. So. But I mean, it comes back to that momentum building. And this is the how, right? The why is, you know, got to do it now because you'll never get to it if you don't. But the how is to break it down. So again, like we said, let's say you want to learn Spanish this year, your one action for the first day of the year could be just to create an account on I talk here, something, some platform where you can find a tutor, create an account.

0:04:49The next day you come back, you search for teachers. The next day, you send five messages to get rates from them, right? So this is how we take action and we build excitement for what we're doing. Yeah. And I love that each of those steps would be very quick. Would take less than five minutes. So if you, we know that you are busy, people, a lot of you are working in English business professionals. You don't have a lot of free time. Everyone has five minutes. They can devote to do one small thing each day. Carve out a little more time if you can, but make it a step-by-step process so that every day you accomplish something. Yeah. And I think that's how we get to the point where we'll eventually hit the point where this is now a habit. So I know, I think I've heard quotes. I don't know the science. But it takes two to three weeks to form a habit, right? Aubrey, more or less? Yes, exactly. And it's so true. I've noticed that in my life. And even when it comes to language learning, if I'm using an app, if I do it for about three weeks every day, then I no longer need that alarm or that reminder. My brain has that habit and I'll do it without a prompt. Yeah. It just becomes part of who you are. So I mean, today's takeaway, guys, is don't wait to study. If you have a goal to become fluent and natural and confident in English this year, take your first steps in the first week of the year, right? Aubrey, what do you think? Yeah. It's a really, really, it's a really good advice. You guys take that advice. Yeah. And Aubrey, I would also tell you up to it all, there's English. Do you do some stuff on the aisle side of things?
