Hey Michelle, how's everything going in New York City? Hey Lindsay, everything's good, everything's good, how are you? Feeling good, feeling good, oh my gosh Michelle, you know a lot of our listeners, they come to us, and they ask us this one question. How can they forget about their English mistakes? How can they get over it and just connect? Because we believe in connection, not perfection here in all-year English. But what is one practical thing they can actually do to get over their mistakes and move past them? What do you think? Well, I think that's all about really throwing yourself into the experience. Right? you know really just focusing on the experience instead. for example, living in an international house or with American people when you're living in the United States. Right, just like you're all in. Lindsay, what do you think about that? I love that expression for our listeners today to be all in.

100% immersed. Yeah, you know when I traveled to South America back in 2008, I lived for three months in Buenos Aires, Argentina. And I was looking for an apartment. I found a place to live. It was truly an international house. There was a French woman, a French guy. There was an American guy and there was me. And then there were two Italians. And there was an Argentine. All of us lived in a house together. We had our own rooms. We would have dinner together. But as soon as I went there to interview with them, they said rule number one and the only rule of the house is that this is a Spanish-speaking house. So everyone there except for the Argentine guy were there to learn Spanish. So you weren't allowed to speak English at all in the house. Oh wow. Oh wow. So how was that experience for you? Like were you worried about your mistakes or did you then kind of just forget about it? It was so cool. This is really, and you know we know not everyone is living abroad in an English-speaking country. But if you have a chance to do something like this guys just do it because at that point the focus went on the relationships that I was building with my friends, my French friends in Spanish. We were having, of course, we had some Italians in the house. They were cooking dinner for us. Lovely dinners with wonderful Italian salsa as they say.

Oh it was so cool. And then we got dancing in, you know, the Argentine evening. But yeah, that's where I really solidified fluency in that house because I stuck to that rule. And it was pretty gutsy I had to say. Actually, to just move in and do that a lot of people I think would just be like I don't want to have to speak English. I'm sorry Spanish or my you know can't speak my native language. I don't want. I can agree with that. You are uncomfortable a lot of the time guys, but these are the risks we have to take. You know Michelle what do you think have you ever lived in an international house or been in this kind of situation? Yeah well, you know I've lived abroad a couple of times, but I like I unfortunately I wouldn't say that I've had the experience that you had because I lived with mostly Americans. Yeah. So I was learning another language, but I was like in kind of bubble. So we were then you know able to speak English at the end of the day. And so I did take classes, but I do think it's like I wish that I had that experience that you had where you're like learning through living you know. Yeah, did you have, so how did that work. so when you were you could always fall back on English right if you couldn't explain something in the native language with the target language you could fall back.

0:04:14
Yeah, there was like not a not there was like no pressure there were no stakes. it was kind of like, I like to learn. Yeah, like and I did, but I don't think that I was able to learn in the same way you were and I wish that I had had that experience. Event though I was taking a class, I was in it like I was excited like yeah. I don't know there wasn't the same like the stakes were not as high. The stakes were not as high. I love that expression too guys this is a bonus vocabulary words for today. Yeah, right Michelle? what does that expression mean just so our listeners can write this down today? The stakes when the stakes are high, it's like it matters a lot, because for some specific reason. like the stakes are high when you're learning English, it's like they're high because you need to communicate you don't have your first language to fall back on. Exactly, so I think there is something to that because it's a mental shift that you go through. you don't have a safety net. You know, there's no safety net. there's nothing you can fall back on. you can't translate that into your native language you have to find a way to that creates language flexibility a lot of our listeners. we know guys you want to create that flexibility for yourself. Yeah, yeah exactly, so I think that's the moment, even though you think you'll focus more on your mistakes, probably you focus left because at first. maybe you focus more on the mistakes. I'm correct me if I'm wrong, but like at first, like you said it's uncomfortable, and then you start to like you said think about the relationship. think of like, what's cooking? what's going on? and exactly and that will kind of it changes the focus. right, like it changes your options. so you change the focus, yeah I completely agree. so guys, so how does this apply to our listeners guys maybe you are getting ready to enroll in college in the US or the UK.
