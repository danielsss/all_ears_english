0:01:33Aubrey, have you ever been to a Caribbean island or any sort of island where they have cool accents? No, I've always wanted to. It's really not that far for me to get to Florida and sail to the Caribbean. I've never had that opportunity. What about you? We went to... Let's see, I went to St. Bart's Sand Martine with my mom when I was in my 20s. Yeah, but other than that, no, but I love the accents. Like the Jamaican accent, for example. Like there are so many places that actually speak English, you guys, where English is one of the languages or the language that is official that we don't think about as an English-speaking country, right? Like we always think about like America, England, Australia, whatever. But you guys, English is spoken in so many more countries like South Africa, Nigeria, Singapore, Trinidad, and like each of these places has their own English essentially. Yes, exactly. I did have a couple of students in the Bronx from a couple of different places. One was from Ghana and she spoke perfect English but with this beautiful accent and the cutest little boy from Nigeria and same thing. He spoke English totally fluently with this beautiful accent. I'm actually a little jealous of someone who has the American accent, not my favorite. I'm not going to lie. Seriously, it's not. I know. Well, maybe it's just because it's normal use to it.

0:03:07So it seems boring, but like I totally agree. It is old hat. That is a great phrase. I love it. That's a great idiom you guys. So the reason why we're talking about this today is because we are going to show you parts of an interview we did with a guy named Matt and he is from Trinidad. He lives in the UK but he's from Trinidad and he actually taught us some very cool vocabulary. So we're going to talk about his island of vocab and tell you what we say in America that might mean the same thing. But first, Aubrey, let's go ahead and listen to Matt introduce himself. Awesome. Well, these are some very generic phrases. You have to understand that the colloquial English that is spoken in Trinidad is a derivative of English, French, Spanish and maybe a few odds and sogs of some of the languages that have been mishmashed together and has evolved over time. Oh wow. Okay. So it is just like regular English. It is constantly evolving and changing, but some generic forms that have remained I will use today. For example, holio. All right. So towards the end there, he said the first word he wanted to talk about was oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm probably not saying that right. But what do you think that means? My guess is it sounds a little bit like all y'all in the south. Totally. And it sort of just means everyone. All of you.

0:04:46I, yeah, I think you're right. I think you nailed it, Aubrey. But let's go back to Matt so we can hear his explanation. I love you, but we say holio. Oh, right. So it's almost like we just took those four words and just compressed and really tightly because we just felt like it would be much easier to see. All right. So just like a quick little little aside here, he said four words, but it's actually three, right? All of you. So Aubrey, that you were correct. I nailed it. It's right. It's just like, oh, we use that in the States. A lot of people will say all y'all, but it sounds so different in his accent that you maybe wouldn't even realize that that's what he's saying. Yeah, totally. I mean, this is a great example of how understanding natives when they are relaxed, when they're speaking very naturally, when they're very informal, when they're talking to each other. Guys, this is a great example of why that's hard to understand sometimes, right? Because we shorten a lot of stuff. Like we're really lazy when we talk. Like instead of going to, we say, gunna instead of I don't know, like that's a long phrase. That's just that's too much effort. So we say, don't know. And so when this goes for all of us, right? We're all pretty lazy. We're dropping the ends of our words. We're squishing them together. This I think it's especially extreme in certain parts of the world or in certain parts of the United States, right? I know we do this a lot in Idaho.

0:06:22We drop the ends of words. We almost never pronounce the G at the end of a word. And in Texas, that's the special where you'll hear this y'all. They would never say all of you. They're just going to say y'all. And you know what? I spent some time in Pittsburgh and instead of y'all, they say yuns like why you and S like it's so interesting to me all of these Englishes, you know how like these dialects are completely normal where they are spoken, but it might sound foreign to us. All right. Now I really I want to hear more of Matt's awesome accent. I want to hear him use this in a sentence. Aubrey, should we do that? Yes, let's hear us. I'm excited. This is really fun. But it's kind of sing songy, right? It says like I would say something of the nature. Let's say if I was saying you two are reporting a very fabulous show, I would say audio recording and I're really good, should I boy? You know, I love how he describes it as sing songy. That's something, that's a phrase I really like and I'm not sure if students know what what does that mean? This episode is brought to you by Colloxil. For soft comfy stools use Colloxil with Senna, the pink one that softened stools and encourages bowel movement to give reliable know-for-night relief. It's Stefan with everything you need to know about stools. Now I don't want to push it, push it too hard, but I even made a Stefan stool playlist to help you get a good feeling.

0:07:50So try Australia's number one constipation tab at Grand Colloxil. Softened stools relieves constipation, always be the label and follow the directions for use. Yeah, it almost sounds more melodic, like it goes up and down and almost sounds more like you're singing a song when you speak and it's true, some Englishes do sound more sing songy. They sound more almost like poetry being read. Totally. And like I remember when I was studying Spanish, right? And my teachers later on would try and show us movies from different countries like Cuba and all these places. So we could start to identify different Spanish accents. And like it's the same in any language, right? People in certain places will sound more musical when they're speaking. Like, is there an American accent that might be considered sing songy? Because ours isn't, for sure. No, right, I wouldn't say anywhere on the west so much, but I do feel like the Midwest, when you hear someone from like the movie Fargo, the way they say the o's, it does sound a little bit sing songy to me. That's a good point. That's a good point. All right, let's go back to Matt and hear how he says wow when he's at home in Trinidad. If I wanted to say like wow, in terms of saying wow, that's excellent. Something else who would say is like, ay, ay, ay, does that a real serious show going on there? All right, Aubrey, now that sounds like Spanish to me, ay, ay, ay.

0:09:26Yes, a little bit, right? So he told us this is used for extremes, good or bad. And yeah, they definitely do this in Spanish too. Um, Matt was saying he thinks this might actually come from Spanish, which makes sense. Right. Yeah, because Trinidad English is a combination of so many languages, not just English. So yeah, that does make sense. And to be honest, I mean, Americans, even if they don't speak Spanish, they even say this, right? Like I say this sometimes, if someone gives me some bad news or surprising news, right? I'll be like, oh, ay, ay, I'm so sorry. Yep, exactly. Or if someone tells a bad joke, like a dad joke, I might be like, ay, ay, ay. Such a good point. Oh my god, that is such a great way to use this. Um, so yeah, guys, Americans use this phrase. This is something we use with each other quite a bit, actually. It is very expressive. Um, okay. This next phrase, Aubrey, is so cool. It's a tag question. Um, like, like an, like an American English, right? Some people might say, yeah, after they say something to check if they're right or not. Like, you went to that party too, yeah. Um, I think this is more from English and other countries, but I know it's something I started saying when I was around so many British people and Australian people. Um, so this is something I do. I do tag, yeah, for, for clarity. Uh, I do too. And I hear it a lot for sure. Well, just, um, just to give someone that eat like, we know they're going to say, yes, we know they're going to agree. We're saying something that we, we already know basically, right? So we'll say like, oh, you did that yesterday, yeah? And they're just like, yeah, totally. It is one of those, um, Britishisms that has definitely invaded America for sure. A lot of us use that. But let's find out what they say in Trinidad. In Trinidad, we say, ent, right? Which means, yeah, which means like, not so, ent, ENT. And you, can you use that in a phrase? Give us an example. I'd be like, uh, let me see.

0:11:35This is a very informative show. And, um, so yeah, I mean, ent, right? That's something I've never heard before. But it does mean the same thing as yeah, or even isn't it is something we might put at the end to check that we're saying something correct, right? Um, it's so cool to hear his accent though. I know it's so fun. And he's so right that they use that in Canada all the time to say A at the end, you know, if you're here take off A on Strange Brew, but they really do in person at the end of almost everything if they just, they know you're going to agree they add that A. I love it. I want, man, this makes me feel like I don't talk cool. I want to, I want to sound cooler like all the people we're talking about today. Um, anyway, guys, now you can sound cool. You can connect with people from Trinidad now, but we've also talked about the equivalent in American English today. So Aubrey and I are going to do a quick little role play to show you all of that vocab we've talked about throughout today's episode. Um, all right. Here we go, Aubrey. Uh, hey, y'all going to that barbecue tonight? Uh, we can't. We have other plans. Oh, that's too bad. What are y'all up to? Actually, you won't believe this, but we were invited to a super fancy dinner at the governor's house. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's crazy. You'll send me pictures, yeah? For sure. Uh, sweet. Okay. So guys, I just showed you all of the vocab from today. We have y'all. Um, we have I-I-I-I. We have, yeah, as a tag. So guys, definitely come back to the blog and check out the list of words. This is episode 38. All right, Aubrey. Thanks for chatting today.

0:13:29Yeah, first of all, if we have to have boring dialects, at least we can share some really fun accents from our guests. All right. All right. Cool. All right. Have a good day, Aubrey.
